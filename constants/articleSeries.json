        "longDescription": "<p>This comprehensive series transforms your Next.js application from a black box into a fully observable system using OpenTelemetry and SigNoz. Starting with basic instrumentation, you'll progress through real-world monitoring scenarios to production-ready observability.</p><p>Learn to track everything that matters: server-side traces and API performance, client-side Web Vitals and widget impact, structured logging with trace correlation, exception monitoring, and external API dependencies. You'll also master production concerns like sampling strategies, data sanitization, alerting, and scaling—whether deploying on Vercel or self-hosted infrastructure.</p><p>By the end, you'll have unified observability across your entire Next.js stack, from browser performance to backend bottlenecks, all visualized in SigNoz dashboards with actionable alerts.</p>",
