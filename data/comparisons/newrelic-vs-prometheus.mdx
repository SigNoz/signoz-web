## New Relic vs Prometheus: An Overview

New Relic is a versatile monitoring tool that offers a wide range of features, including Application Performance Monitoring (APM), log monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, and real-user monitoring. In contrast, Prometheus focuses on monitoring time-series data.

Prometheus is open-source and free to use, while New Relic is a paid tool, which can become expensive as usage scales. Prometheus is commonly used in conjunction with Grafana, where Grafana serves as the visualization layer, providing a user interface to visualize Prometheus metrics.

To use New Relic, you simply need to sign up, create an account, and follow the onboarding steps to get started. As Prometheus is open-source, it requires self-installation and management. However, managed services for Prometheus are available from many cloud vendors, including [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/).



## Getting Started: New Relic

### New Relic

New Relic is cloud-based. All it requires is for you to sign up, and your account is created within seconds.

### Prometheus

Prometheus provides several deployment alternatives, such as utilizing Docker, installing from source, using configuration management systems like Ansible, using pre-compiled binaries on multiple operating systems (Darwin, Linux, Windows, etc.), and using Homebrew, the macOS package manager. I utilized Docker to set up Prometheus on my machine.

The deployment processes for both tools are straightforward, but New Relic's process is particularly seamless, requiring only a simple sign-up.

## Data Collection: New Relic

### New Relic

New Relic provides a total of 1083 data sources for data collection without the need for any configuration. Collecting data from my sample Python application was very easy. All I had to do was install the New Relic agent on my system and start the application with the agent.

New Relic also provides the flexibility to collect custom data in cases where New Relic does not automatically support a given data source. This could include custom trace data, custom infrastructure data, and custom attributes and events.

    <figcaption><i>Data collection in New Relic</i></figcaption>
</figure>


### Prometheus

Prometheus also supports data collection from different data sources. It collects data through a pull-based model, where it actively scrapes metrics from configured targets at regular intervals. These targets can be servers, applications, or services that expose metrics in a format that Prometheus can understand, typically over HTTP. It uses a configuration file to define the targets it should scrape, including the URL, the scrape interval, and any specific metrics to collect. From the below image, you can see I was able to scrape metrics from several target endpoints.

    <figcaption><i>Prometheus scraping metrics from HTTP endpoints</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Both tools have impressive data collection capabilities, but New Relic stands out for the broader range of data it can accept.

## Visualization Capabilities: New Relic

### New Relic

New Relic has impressive visualization capabilities. It provides pre-built dashboards for easy understanding and analysis of data, ensuring that you can quickly identify trends and insights. After the New Relic agent collected and sent my application data to New Relic, I could visualize and monitor my application without needing to create a dashboard.

Users also have the flexibility to create and customize dashboards from scratch or by using custom queries to monitor the exact application metrics needed. 

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/newrelic-vs-prometheus-dashboard-nr.webp" alt="Dashboard creation in New Relic"/>
    <figcaption><i>Dashboard creation in New Relic</i></figcaption>
</figure>


For users who may require more customization options beyond what the standard charts and dashboards can offer, New Relic allows the development of New Relic Apps or the customization of existing apps from the <a href = "https://opensource.newrelic.com/nerdpacks" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >App catalog</a>.

### Prometheus

Prometheus, on the other hand, has limited visualization capabilities. It has a very basic built-in expression browser for visualizing metrics, but this doesnâ€™t provide much information about your metrics data. Prometheus provides only table and graph visualization options. I couldn't make sense of my application metrics using them, so I had to send my application data to Grafana for visualization, which required setting up Grafana separately.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/newrelic-vs-prometheus-graph.webp" alt="Graph visualization in Prometheus"/>
    <figcaption><i>Graph visualization in Prometheus</i></figcaption>
</figure>


New Relic clearly provides advanced visualization capabilities as opposed to Prometheus.

## APM (Application Performance Monitoring): New Relic

### New Relic

New Relic's APM feature offers extensive monitoring capabilities for all your applications and microservices. It provides real-time monitoring of application telemetry data, including metrics, logs, events, and transactions, through a combination of pre-built and custom dashboards. 

Additionally, it extends its functionality with features like service maps, offering visualization of inter-service relationships and dependencies within an application, SLA reports, vulnerability management, and much more. New Relicâ€™s APM feature is comprehensive, and I was particularly impressed by the depth of information it provided about my application.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/newrelic-vs-prometheus-apm-nr.webp" alt="APM in New Relic"/>
    <figcaption><i>APM in New Relic</i></figcaption>
</figure>


### Prometheus

Prometheus currently lacks APM functionality as it is focused on the collection of metrics data only.

Of both tools, New Relic stands out with its impressive APM feature.

## Data Storage: New Relic

### New Relic

New Relic utilizes the New Relic Database (<a href = "https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/get-started/nrdb-horsepower-under-hood" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >NRDB</a>) for data storage, a system designed to handle vast volumes of data efficiently. NRDB is capable of ingesting massive datasets, enabling it to deliver queries with exceptional speed. Because NRDB is hosted in the cloud, it benefits from a distributed architecture that supports unlimited scalability. This setup ensures that your data storage needs are met, regardless of the volume of data you generate.

The default data retention period is a minimum of 8 days, with the option to extend this period up to a year for certain data types, such as metrics.

### Prometheus

Prometheus has an in-built time-series database optimized for the efficient handling of high-performance time-series data. This database facilitates rapid querying and the retrieval of historical data, ensuring that users can access and analyze metrics collected over time with ease. Unlike New Relic, Prometheus does not provide long-term data storage capabilities. To manage data over extended periods, it requires integration with other tools.

New Relicâ€™s NRDB architecture makes it a clear win over Prometheus for data storage.

## Data Query: Tie

### New Relic

New Relic uses the New Relic Query Language (NRQL) for data queries. NRQL allows for the creation of custom charts, addresses troubleshooting and business analysis questions, and configuration of NRQL-based alerts.

Additionally, NRQL integrates with New Relic's APIs, such as <a href = "https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/nerdgraph-graphiql-nrql-tutorial" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >NerdGraph</a>, for more complex data retrieval needs. It can be used to create simple queries, such as fetching rows of data in a raw tabular form to give insight into individual events and run powerful calculations on the data before it's presented to you, such as crafting funnels based on how end users are using your site or application.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/newrelic-vs-prometheus-nrql.webp" alt="Data query in New Relic using NRQL"/>
    <figcaption><i>Data query in New Relic using NRQL</i></figcaption>
</figure>


### Prometheus

Prometheus provides a powerful and flexible querying language known as PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) for querying and analyzing time-series data. PromQL allows users to perform a wide range of operations, including filtering, aggregation, and mathematical transformations, on the collected metrics data. Users can write expressive queries to extract valuable insights and monitor system performance effectively. With support for functions like rate, sum, and histogram_quantile, PromQL enables advanced analysis and visualization of metrics data.

    <figcaption><i>Query in Prometheus using PromQL</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Both tools have good data query capabilities.

## Alerting: New Relic

### New Relic

New Relic's alerting feature, in collaboration with its AI capabilities, provides a robust and intelligent system for managing alerts and addressing issues. It supports anomaly detection, alert organization through tagging, signal evaluation at predetermined thresholds, and issue routing via notifications.

The alerting system is equipped with extensive capabilities, including the configuration of signals for evaluation at specific thresholds, root cause analysis, alert organization through tagging, the identification of anomalies, and the routing of issues to systems via notifications. The AI feature enhances the alerting system by enriching issue notifications with additional New Relic data, providing deeper insights into each alert. It correlates incoming incidents to identify patterns and suppresses noise, ensuring that you receive notifications only when necessary.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/newrelic-vs-prometheus-alert-nr.webp" alt="Alerting in New Relic"/>
    <figcaption><i>Alerting in New Relic</i></figcaption>
</figure>


### Prometheus

In contrast, Prometheus lacks a built-in mechanism for explicitly configuring alert rules. Instead, alerting is handled by a component known as Alertmanager. Alertmanager handles alerts, including silence, inhibition, aggregation, and notification transmission. It can be set up to send alerts through a variety of channels, including email, on-call notification systems, and chat platforms, through the definition of alert rules. Once the conditions in the alert rules are met, Prometheus creates the alert instances and sends them to Alertmanager.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/newrelic-vs-prometheus-alertmanager.webp" alt="Received alert from Prometheus in Alertmanager"/>
    <figcaption><i>Received alert from Prometheus in Alertmanager</i></figcaption>
</figure>


The integration of AI with New Relic's Alerting feature enhances its alerting capabilities, making it a superior alerting option.

## UI/UX: New Relic

### New Relic

New Relic's user interface is designed to be straightforward and accessible, making it very beginner-friendly. As a new user, I find it incredibly easy to navigate.
