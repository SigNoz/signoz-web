Object storage, such as Amazon S3, is perfect for storing massive amounts of unstructured data such as photographs, movies, and backups. Block storage, on the other hand, is more analogous to traditional disk drives, making it ideal for databases or applications that require consistent I/O performance.
- Networking: Networking services ensure that your cloud resources are linked together and can communicate successfully with the outside world. This includes services such as load balancers, which distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure availability and reliability, and content delivery networks (CDNs), which reduce latency by caching content closer to users.

### Traditional Hosting vs. Cloud Infrastructure:

Unlike traditional hosting, which frequently involves renting physical servers with set resources, cloud infrastructure allows for dynamic resource allocation. A standard hosting configuration, for example, would include leasing a dedicated server with a specified amount of CPU, RAM, and storage. Cloud infrastructure, on the other hand, enables you to alter these resources in real time based on current demand, assuring both cost-efficiency and optimal performance. This capacity to scale resources up and down is very useful for startups and developing organizations with changing workloads.
