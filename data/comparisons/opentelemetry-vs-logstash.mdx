<Figure src="/img/comparisons/2024/11/opentelemetry-vs-logstash-image%201.webp" alt="Basic Flow of the Migration" caption="Basic Flow of the Migration" />

Let's now look at some of the migration strategies for more clarity.

### Moving from Logstash to OpenTelemetry

You should start by migrating a single, non-critical service with OpenTelemetry to identify any configuration or data consistency issues early on.

### Running Both Systems in Parallel

During the transition, you should run Logstash and OpenTelemetry side by side. It enables data comparison in real time which will help you to verify data accuracy and ensure that essential metrics and logs are consistently captured across both systems.

You should also ensure that the telemetry data aligns between Logstash and OpenTelemetry by comparing output from both systems. It confirms that data integrity is preserved.

### Data Transformation Considerations

OpenTelemetry’s processors allow custom data transformations. It enables compatibility with Logstash’s existing field mappings and semantic structures.

Example of Data Transformation in OpenTelemetry:

```yaml
processors:
  transform:
    log_statements:
      - context: log
        statements:
          - set(body, ParseJSON(body))
```

### Best Practices for Migration

- You should align Logstash’s field structures to OpenTelemetry’s semantic conventions, preserving data format consistency throughout the observability pipeline.
- You should implement batching in the OpenTelemetry collector to optimize performance, especially during high-volume data transfers.
- You should establish robust error-handling practices within OpenTelemetry to ensure issues are captured efficiently during data collection or transformation.

### Hybrid Strategy

If your team is looking to use both tools then you can follow a hybrid approach as it would allow Logstash to focus on specific log transformations, while OpenTelemetry manages telemetry data collection and metrics.

### Data Mapping and Consistency

In the case of migration, maintaining data consistency is very important.

- You should ensure Logstash’s fields are accurately mapped to OpenTelemetry, so data is consistently represented.
- You should conduct regular comparisons of key metrics and logs to validate that data quality remains high across both systems.
