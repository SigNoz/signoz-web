    <figcaption><i>New Relicâ€™s query builder tab</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Overall, both tools have good data querying capabilities.

## Infrastructure Monitoring: Dynatrace

### Dynatrace

I had to install <a href = "https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/platform/oneagent/how-one-agent-works" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >One Agent</a> on my host machine to monitor my infrastructure. One Agent is what Dynatrace uses for conducting full-stack monitoring of your infrastructure and the services operating within it. It gave me a holistic view of my infrastructure performance, including incoming and outgoing connections, host performance, process analysis, disk usage, and more. The only drawback was not being able to set it up on macOS, as it doesnâ€™t support it. I had to install it on a Ubuntu VM instead.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/dynatrace-vs-newrelic-infra-monitoring-dynatrace.webp" alt="Infrastructure monitoring on Dynatrace"/>
    <figcaption><i>Infrastructure monitoring on Dynatrace</i></figcaption>
</figure>


The Process Analysis section provided me with information on all the running processes on my infrastructure, along with vital stats on memory and CPU usage. This level of detail is useful for keeping tabs on my system's performance and making informed decisions about resource allocation and optimization.

    <figcaption><i>Process analysis</i></figcaption>
</figure>


### New Relic

New Relic facilitates the monitoring of a variety of infrastructure components through the deployment of an infrastructure agent. Upon installation on a macOS host, which is supported by New Relic, the agent automatically collects and sends data to the New Relic platform. It collects data on the infrastructure and the services running on it.

While New Relic provides a solid foundation for monitoring infrastructure and services, I found that Dynatrace offered a broader array of capabilities and a deeper level of insight into my infrastructure. Dynatrace's comprehensive features provide a more detailed analysis of the system's performance.

    <figcaption><i>Infrastructure monitoring on New Relic</i></figcaption>
</figure>


If your goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of all activities occurring within your infrastructure, Dynatrace stands out as a robust solution.

## APM: New Relic

### Dynatrace

I had a hard time understanding the APM setup for Dynatrace because APM is not immediately visible as an option within the user interface. I found in the Dynatrace docs that you can instrument your application with OpenTelemetry or utilize the One Agent SDK, which complements the Dynatrace One Agent. The latter approach necessitates modifications to the application code, which may not be ideal for everyone.

### New Relic

New Relic has an APM & Services section, which is easy to locate. Monitoring an application requires adding that application as a data source and installing the agent for the application on your host machine. For example, a Python application requires a Python agent. Once your application is started with the agent, New Relic automatically collects your application data for monitoring. The process is very seamless.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/dynatrace-vs-newrelic-sample-app-new-relic.webp" alt="My sample Python application being monitored in New Relic APM"/>
    <figcaption><i>My sample Python application being monitored in New Relic APM</i></figcaption>
</figure>


In the case of APM, a direct comparison between Dynatrace and New Relic is challenging due to the limited amount of information obtained from Dynatrace for comparison purposes. However, considering the ease of setup and simplicity of New Relic, it is the better option when it comes to APM.

## Log Management: Dynatrace

### Dynatrace

Log management in Dynatrace is powered by <a href = "https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/grail" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Grail</a>, which is designed to manage log data efficiently without requiring schemas or indexing and allows users to store petabytes of data that can be queried at any time. Once the OneAgent is deployed on a host, it seamlessly ingests log data into the Dynatrace platform.

Users can define custom log ingestion rules with OneAgent and control the retention of log data by placing it into designated data retention buckets. This flexibility allows for retention periods that align with business and compliance requirements, whether for debugging or auditing purposes.
