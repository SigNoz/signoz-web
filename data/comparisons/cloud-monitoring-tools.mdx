As dependence on cloud providers rises, it’s important that you have the right tool to monitor performance, find issues, triage, and remove bottlenecks. There are many different cloud monitoring tools suitable for different use cases. Choosing the correct one can provide your business with a competitive advantage.

## Why Not Use In-Built Cloud Monitoring Tools?

If you’re hosting your infrastructure on a cloud service provider, chances are that they already have monitoring tools. For example, if you’re on AWS, you get Amazon CloudWatch. If you’re on GCP, you get Cloud Monitoring, and if you’re running on Microsoft Azure, you get Azure Monitor.

While In-Built Cloud Monitoring tools might be an easy solution for your initial needs, they come with challenges.

1. Vendor lock-in makes it difficult to move your entire monitoring pipeline in case you choose to go with a new cloud provider in the future.
2. If you’re running a hybrid cloud or a multi-cloud setup, then you would need additional monitoring tools to observe your entire stack.
3. They might offer a broad range of capabilities, but their capabilities aren’t in-depth.
4. They usually don’t offer a high level of customization.
5. For advanced needs like APM and SIEM, the in-built monitoring tools might not be enough.
6. Integration with your existing monitoring stack might become a challenge as they don’t provide great integration endpoints.
7. While the pay-as-you-go model might look attractive in the beginning, the costs increase quite rapidly to meet the monitoring requirements. There isn’t any option for custom pricing.
