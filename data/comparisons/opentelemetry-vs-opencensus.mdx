```python
from opencensus.trace.tracer import Tracer

def process_request(request):
    tracer = Tracer()
    with tracer.span(name="process_request") as span:
        span.add_attribute("request_id", request.id)
        # Process the request
        result = do_something(request)
        span.add_attribute("result_status", result.status)
    return result
```

This code demonstrates how to instrument a code with OpenCensus for distributed tracing. The key steps include:

After (OpenTelemetry):

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def process_request(request):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("process_request") as span:
        span.set_attribute("request_id", request.id)
        # Process the request
        result = do_something(request)
        span.set_attribute("result_status", result.status)
    return result
```

This code uses OpenTelemetry to trace the process of handling a request. It performs
