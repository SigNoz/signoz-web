You may have noticed that most hosting platforms charge based on a pay-as-you-go model. To avoid incurring unexpected costs, it is essential to monitor the traffic coming to your applications. By keeping an eye on your application's usage, you can ensure that your costs remain within budget. 

## Monitoring Your Application Across Platforms

As you transition to a new hosting platform, it's crucial to maintain visibility into your application's performance and resource usage. This is especially important when using pay-as-you-go services to avoid unexpected costs. SigNoz, an open-source application performance monitoring (APM) tool, can help you keep track of your application regardless of which Heroku alternative you choose.

SigNoz offers:

- Real-time performance monitoring
