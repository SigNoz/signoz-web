## Dynatrace vs AppDynamics: Key Differences

**AI-Driven Analytics:** <br/>

- **Dynatrace:** Dynatrace sets itself apart with its powerful AI engine, Davis AI, in analyzing vast amounts of data in real-time. This allows it to perform automatic root cause analysis, auto application topology discovery, auto-coded workflows, and AIOps.

- **AppDynamics:** AppDynamics also offers AI-driven analytics features, including  AIOps, anomaly detection, and performance insights but Dynatrace's AI capabilities provide a more automated and intelligent approach.
    
**Real User Monitoring:**<br/>
    
- **Dynatrace:** Dynatrace captures full visibility of customer experience across every digital transaction, mapping the whole user journey, not just bits and pieces. It leverages its AI to pinpoint issues and root causes. It also provides a <a href = "https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/digital-experience-monitoring/visually-complete" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Visually complete and Speed index</a>¬†feature that eliminates user experience blind spots and provides the most accurate and relevant measurement of user experience.

- **AppDynamics:** AppDynamics monitors key metrics across user devices. It provides Experience Journey Mapping (ExJM), automatically identifying the most frequented user journeys and tracking evolving user behaviors within the application. ExJM also visualizes the most trafficked application paths and assesses their performance in real-time.
    
**Cost:**<br/>
    
- **Dynatrace:** Dynatrace offers a transparent and straightforward pricing model. The pricing is host-based, with discounts available for larger commitments. This model can be cost-effective for businesses with consistent or predictable usage patterns. However, for large deployments or those requiring extensive monitoring capabilities, Dynatrace can get expensive quickly. This is because the cost scales with the number of hosts being monitored.

- **AppDynamics:** AppDynamics pricing is more straightforward, with fixed monthly rates. This makes budgeting easier, especially for businesses with a fixed number of servers or cores. However, for large deployments, costs can also add up. Both Dynatrace and AppDynamics can be very expensive.
    
**Learning Curve:**<br/>
    
- **Dynatrace:** Dynatrace has a steep learning curve for new users, due to its extensive features and UI.
    
- **AppDynamics:** It has a clean modern UI and is easier to navigate compared to Dynatrace.
