## Which Approach Should You Choose?

With AppDynamics now part of Splunk's portfolio under Cisco, the question shifts from "which one" to "how to best leverage both." However, understanding their distinct strengths helps optimize your observability strategy.

<KeyPointCallout title="AppDynamics-Focused Approach">
Best when your primary goal is deep application performance monitoring with out-of-the-box code-level insights. It's ideal for teams that want a guided APM solution with automatic visualization of complex distributed applications. AppDynamics excels when you need to quickly identify slow transactions, get method-level diagnostics, and connect application performance to business metrics.
</KeyPointCallout>

<KeyPointCallout title="Splunk-Focused Approach">
Optimal when log management is critical to your operations or when you need a unified platform for logs, metrics, traces, and security events. It's perfect for SREs who frequently move between metrics and logs during investigations and for organizations seeking to integrate observability with security practices.
</KeyPointCallout>

### Leveraging the Unified Approach

With Cisco's acquisition bringing these tools together, many organizations are now implementing a unified strategy:

1. **Integrated Workflow:** Use AppDynamics for application monitoring and Splunk for log aggregation and security, with deep linking between them for seamless troubleshooting.

2. **Specialized Teams:** Allow development teams to focus on AppDynamics for application insights while operations and security teams leverage Splunk's broader analytics capabilities.

3. **Tiered Deployment:** Deploy AppDynamics for your most critical business applications while using Splunk to monitor your broader IT infrastructure and security posture.

<KeyPointCallout title="Bottom Line">
Evaluate based on your primary challenges and team structure. Leverage AppDynamics' strength in application performance and user experience monitoring alongside Splunk's powerful log analytics and security capabilities. The integration between these platforms now allows you to build a comprehensive observability strategy that draws on the best of both tools while maintaining workflow continuity.
</KeyPointCallout>

## Splunk Observability vs. Other APM Solutions

With AppDynamics now part of Splunk's Observability suite, Splunk is positioning itself against other full-stack monitoring leaders like Datadog, New Relic, and Dynatrace. Here's how they compare:

- **Splunk Observability (with AppDynamics):** The combined platform now offers unified metrics, traces, logs, and digital experience monitoring. Its greatest strength is in log analytics, where it can ingest and query massive volumes of data with flexibility. The addition of AppDynamics strengthens Splunk's APM capabilities significantly.

- **Datadog:** A popular cloud-native observability platform with APM, logs, metrics, and more in a unified SaaS offering. Datadog is known for easy onboarding and rich cloud service integrations, but its pricing model can lead to surprises for large-scale deployments.

- **New Relic:** A veteran in the APM space that has evolved into a full observability platform. New Relic offers robust APM capabilities and a relatively transparent pricing model. Its log analytics, while improved, is not as flexible or scalable as Splunk's.

- **Dynatrace:** Known for its AI-driven approach and automated discovery of dependencies. Dynatrace provides precise root-cause analysis but is a relatively heavy, proprietary solution that can be expensive in large environments.

Each platform offers a broad set of features that can monitor modern applications, but factors like ecosystem integration, cost model, and specific feature strengths will influence which is best for your organization.

## SigNoz: An Open-Source Alternative

SigNoz is a modern, open-source observability platform that provides Application Performance Monitoring (APM), metrics, logs, and distributed tracing in a unified solution. Built on OpenTelemetry, it offers comprehensive insights into application performance without the licensing fees associated with proprietary tools.
