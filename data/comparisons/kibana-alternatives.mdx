Kibana is one of the most popular data visualization platforms with its built-in anomaly detection, custom visualization options, or relational analysis. An integral part of the ELK stack, it helps you query and present your data on dashboards in the form of graphs and charts.

But one of the major drawbacks of Kibana is that it can only work with Elasticsearch as the data source. As a result, scaling Kibana independently can be a challenge for organizations. Additionally, its poor support for metrics might lead users to seek alternative solutions.

### 9. Graylog

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/03/kibana-alternatives-graylog.webp" alt=""/>
    <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>


Source: <a href = "https://graylog.org/products/source-available" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Graylog</a>

<a href = "https://graylog.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Graylog</a> is an enterprise-level SIEM tool that can help you search and visualize terabytes of data, get notified with alerts, and create or automate reports. In fact, it has a wide variety of widgets like statistical values, stacked charts, quick value results, or search value counts to help you visualize data from logs. 

You can export searches to empty dashboards, but you need Grafana to visualize data effectively with Graylog. As its primary focus is on log management, it offers limited visualization capabilities. You can still use histograms, scatter plots, or custom dashboards for basic visualizations. It’s great for centralized logging and has native alerting facilities, unlike Kibana.

Plus, Graylog’s visualization capabilities are driven by advanced data aggregation, which allows you to combine and aggregate different types of data in a single chart for a pivot-like experience. You can build pre-defined searches to optimize business efficiencies, reduce downtime, and quickly pull up saved searches to identify and troubleshoot issues faster.

**Pros:** 

1. Data ingestion capabilities are top-tier. 
2. Powerful search options for troubleshooting. 
3. Flexible configuration to meet enterprise needs or infrastructure requirements.

**Cons:** 

1. Limited visualization capabilities and is rather Grafana-dependent. 
2. Unaffordable pricing with a lack of pre-built dashboards or templates.
3. Writing extractors or content packs can be a time- and effort-intensive task.

## Choosing the Right Kibana Alternative

Here are some points you should consider before choosing the right Kibana alternative:

1. **Feature-rich dashboards:** You should have the option of creating custom dashboards based on your use-case and adding different types of visualizations in the form of graphs, charts, heatmaps.
2. **Search functionality:** You should be able to perform basic as well as advanced search on the data you’re visualizing. The ability to add custom filters is an added bonus!
3. **Metrics and alerts:** A good visualization platform allows you to set up aggregate metrics based on custom groups. You should also be able to set up trigger-based alerts across various channels for faster troubleshooting.
4. **Pricing:** Open-source solutions like SigNoz are usually more cost-effective than proprietary solutions. However, for both, keep in mind that you’re only paying for the data that you’re using. Steer clear of hidden costs when it comes to integration, support, or other native functionalities.
5. **Support:** How good is the customer or community support of the visualization tool that you’re using? While some alternatives have elaborate support teams, their response rates are incredibly slow. In comparison, community support can be extremely effective in fixing issues promptly.
6. **Ease of use:** Data visualization should help, not overwhelm. Opt for easy-to-use interfaces with clean UIs, adequate documentation, and configurable alerts, graphs, and dashboards.
