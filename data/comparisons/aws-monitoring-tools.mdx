The Amazon Web Service (AWS) has a vast array of PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS offerings, spanning over 200 cloud services and tools that developers can choose from and couple into one single app to hasten and automate software development. But bringing these AWS resources together means that if a single AWS service configuration is degrading performance or increasing costs across the entire software environment, finding it—without the right monitoring tool—can present a needle in a haystack scenario. Essentially, while Amazon has built its services with high performance in mind, enterprises must monitor and optimize usage, performance, security, and scalability across all AWS service components to keep their apps running smoothly.

As much as monitoring AWS is important, choosing the right monitoring tool is even more critical. There are native monitoring tools and third-party tools, each offering different capabilities, integrations, and features. The ability to monitor metrics, logs, events, and traces across a wide range of AWS services is essential. An ideal tool should provide actionable insights, real-time alerts, and historical data analysis and possess the ability to scale with your AWS environment. In the following paragraphs, we'll highlight the top first-party and third-party monitoring tools while exploring their unique functionalities.

## Why monitor AWS?

The primary goal of monitoring AWS environments is to ensure that your apps are functioning as they should. Other core benefits of AWS monitoring include:

### 1. Swift detection and resolution of issues

AWS monitoring lets you keep track of your app health and set up alerts to proactively detect and address problems before they escalate. This minimizes downtime and service disruptions.

### 2. Efficient resource optimization

Monitoring helps you track resource utilization, including CPU, memory, storage, network bandwidth, and network traffic metrics. Analyzing these metrics allows you to optimize resource allocation, scale resources based on demand, and identify underutilized or over-provisioned resources. This reduces costs, minimizes waste, and improves efficiency.

### 3. Ensures high availability

Availability is a central part of enterprise service level agreements (SLAs). By monitoring the health and performance of vital components, and services within your AWS environment, you can swiftly detect and resolve potential issues that could impact the system, thereby ensuring high availability and meeting up with SLA obligations.

### 4. Enhanced cost optimization

AWS monitoring involves tracking cost-related metrics, such as usage coverage, data transfer costs, and daily estimated costs.  Insights obtained from monitoring help identify cost trends, keep budgets in line, assess the impact of cloud spend on ROI, and facilitate implementing cost-saving measures.

### 5. Improved security and compliance

Keeping a tab on security-related metrics like access logs and configuration changes helps you detect security threats, enhance your security posture, and respond to real-time security incidents. Additionally, AWS monitoring helps ensure compliance with security best practices and industry regulations.

## AWS Monitoring Tools

As mentioned earlier, there are two categories of AWS monitoring tools: 

- AWS native monitoring tools and
- Third-party monitoring tools.

## AWS Native Monitoring Tools

AWS has a range of first-party monitoring tools with varying use cases and capabilities. They include AWS CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Config, Inspector, and Security Hub. AWS native monitoring tools have a central benefit; since they are already part of the AWS ecosystem, setting them up to collect the required telemetry can be done in a few easy clicks. However, their general downside is that they cover your AWS environment only, leaving you to find other tools for the rest of your cloud environment. Below are the specific pros and cons of each tool.

### 1. AWS CloudWatch

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/04/aws-monitoring-tools-aws-cloudwatch.webp" alt="AWS CloudWatch"/>
    <figcaption><i>AWS CloudWatch</i></figcaption>
</figure>


<a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >AWS CloudWatch</a> is a monitoring and observability service that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events across your AWS resources. As a default AWS observability tool, most AWS services, such as S3, EC2, and Kinesis, automatically send metrics to CloudWatch.

### Pros

- CloudWatch Application Insights is built to automatically discover and monitor all underlying resources in your AWS account
- CloudWatch Alarm allows you to define anomalous behavior (e.g. traffic spikes or latency) based on context-specific thresholds and set alarms that trigger prespecified actions, such as auto-scaling.

### Cons

- Only ideal for issue discovery: its overly complex user interface makes troubleshooting and root cause analysis near impossible
- Expensive, unpredictable pricing: Users are charged separately for the number of metrics and events, the volume of logs collected and stored, and the number of queries.

### 2. AWS CloudTrail

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/04/aws-monitoring-tools-aws-cloudtail.webp" alt="AWS CloudTrail"/>
    <figcaption><i>AWS CloudTrail</i></figcaption>
</figure>


<a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >AWS CloudTrail</a> is a logging service that enables governance, auditing, and compliance monitoring of your AWS account. It does this by recording write API calls and user/service activities across the account as events which you can analyze to monitor and troubleshoot operational or security issues resulting from changes to Amazon resources.

### Pros

- CloudTrail Insights for tracking anomalous or unauthorized resource usage
- Can be integrated with CloudWatch to create alarms and automate responses to anomalous events
- Compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and SOX

### Cons

- CloudTrail Insights takes about 36hrs to process CloudTrail Events, pinpoint anomalous activities, and create a trail
- Must be integrated with other tools (e.g. Athena and CloudWatch) to perform querying and alerting functions
- Event history is only retained for 90 days

### 3. AWS Config

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/04/aws-monitoring-tools-aws-config.webp" alt="AWS Config"/>
