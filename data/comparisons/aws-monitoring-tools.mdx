Benefits from a hybrid approach:

- Feed AWS-native telemetry into third-party platforms such as SigNoz, Datadog, or New Relic for centralized monitoring.
- Use AWS-native alerts to trigger incident response or automate remediation using AWS Lambda or EventBridge.
- Visualize AWS and non-AWS environments together by sending all observability data to a single third-party backend.
