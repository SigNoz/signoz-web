## Key features of Prometheus

Some of the key features of Prometheus are:

- **Multi-dimensional data model**<br />
    
    It stores data as time series (data that is tracked at an increment in time). You can also store an optional set of key-value pairs called labels for those metrics. The multi-dimensional data model enables rich contextual metrics monitoring.
    
- **Query language**<br />
    
    Prometheus uses a query language called ‚ÄúProm QL‚Äù to query the metrics data collected.
    
- **Pull model data collection over HTTP**<br />
    
    Data collection for Prometheus is pull-based. It pulls metrics from an application and exposes them in a format it understands on an HTTP endpoint.
    
- **Alerting**<br />
    
    Prometheus uses Alert manager to create alerts on metrics. The alert manager also provides capabilities to group alerts in a single notification.
    
- **Visualization and dashboard**<br />
    
    Prometheus comes with a basic visualization layer and doesn‚Äôt allow for the creation of dashboards.

## Getting Started: Splunk vs Prometheus

Splunk provides a cloud version, a fully managed service that doesn't require any installation. It comes with a 14-day free trial.

Additionally, Splunk provides an Enterprise version designed for deployment on-premises or within a private cloud. This version is beneficial for organizations seeking complete control over their data and infrastructure. It comes with a 60-day free trial.

Prometheus doesn‚Äôt offer a cloud version. It needs to be installed and maintained. If you require a managed version of Prometheus, it has managed services like the <a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus,</a> <a href = "https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus</a> and more that are managed by the providers.

## Metrics monitoring: Splunk vs Prometheus

Metrics monitoring provides insights into system performance, resource utilization, and application behavior. Both Splunk and Prometheus offer robust solutions for metrics monitoring, but they differ significantly in their approaches. Here is how both tools carry out metrics monitoring:

### Splunk

Metrics monitoring in Splunk involves a comprehensive process that starts with the collection of metrics data from various sources. 

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/03/splunk-vs-prometheus-data-sources.webp" alt="Splunk Data ingestion source"/>
    <figcaption><i>Data sources Splunk  can ingest metrics from</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Other than ingesting metrics data, Splunk can automatically convert ingested log data into metrics and insert it into a specified metrics index.

Once the metrics data is ingested, it is indexed and stored in Splunk's proprietary index format, for fast and efficient retrieval of metrics data during query and analysis.

The metrics are then monitored in real-time using different visualizations.  Dashboards can be utilized for this as the <a href = "https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/get-started/welcome.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Splunk Observability Cloud platform</a> comes with out-of-the-box dashboards. Custom dashboards can also be created to monitor custom or other specific metrics and alerts can be set up on the metrics.

Another way to monitor metrics in Splunk is through the use of the <a href = "https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.2.0/Analytics/About" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Analytics Workspace</a>. The Analytics Workspace provides a user interface that allows for monitoring and analysis of metrics and other time series without using SPL. It allows users to easily understand trends and patterns in their metrics data.

### Prometheus

Prometheus is specifically designed for monitoring and alerting on metrics. Metrics monitoring in Prometheus starts with the collection of metric data from different data sources, by scraping metrics from HTTP endpoints exposed by monitored services at regular intervals. Once collected, Prometheus stores the metrics in a local database optimized for time-series data. 

This storage method allows for efficient querying and analysis of the metrics. These metrics can be queried using PromQL, a powerful query language, to analyze the collected metrics. Users can write queries to create temporary time series from the source data, allowing for real-time aggregation and analysis. Alerts can then be set on these metrics for proactiveness in resolving issues before they escalate.

The downside of metrics monitoring in Prometheus is its basic visualization, the expression browser, which doesn‚Äôt provide enough information to understand your metrics data. For better metrics visualization, users would have to send the metrics from Prometheus to a different visualization platform, like Grafana. Prometheus is usually used in combination with Grafana for visualization.

## An alternative to Splunk and Prometheus - SigNoz

While Splunk does offer good metrics monitoring capabilities, it's often not the first choice for organizations specifically looking for metric monitoring solutions, because of the costs that come with it. Splunk is more suited for enterprises and large-scale businesses, hence its robust features. 

Prometheus, in contrast, is open-source and doesn‚Äôt require any license to install and use but you need to maintain it yourself which will require engineering bandwidth. However, its scope is limited to metrics alone. For a holistic understanding of your systems, metrics alone are insufficient. Logs and traces are equally crucial for comprehensive observability and monitoring of services and infrastructure. In such cases, it is best to consider an alternative tool like SigNoz.

SigNoz is an open-source, full-stack Application Performance Monitoring (APM) and observability tool that serves as a great alternative to both Splunk and Prometheus. SigNoz being an OpenTelemetry native tool provides you with metrics, logs, and traces to get a comprehensive view of your systems.¬†<a href = "https://opentelemetry.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry</a>¬†is rapidly becoming the global standard for generating and managing telemetry data (Logs, metrics, and traces).

Regarding cost, SigNoz is highly cost-effective. It is available both as an¬†<a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >open-source software</a>¬†and a¬†[cloud offering](https://signoz.io/teams/).
