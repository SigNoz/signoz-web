Jaeger is an open-source distributed tracing backend that has been on the market for a while. It was developed by Uber Technologies in 2015 and contributed to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It is designed to monitor and troubleshoot complex distributed systems by providing insights into the flow of requests and responses across microservice architectures.

Distributed tracing is critical for cloud-native microservices-based applications. Before we look into Jaeger alternatives, let’s have a brief overview of distributed tracing.

## What is Distributed Tracing?

Distributed tracing is a method used in software development and system monitoring to track and visualize the flow of requests as they propagate through various components of a distributed system or application.

In simpler terms, it's like tracing the journey of a request as it moves through different parts of a complex system, such as microservices, APIs, and databases. Each step in the journey is recorded and linked together, allowing developers and operators to understand how different components interact and contribute to the overall performance and behavior of the system.

Distributed tracing is useful in identifying bottlenecks, latency issues, and errors, enabling teams to diagnose and troubleshoot problems more effectively. It provides insights into the performance and behavior of distributed systems, helping improve reliability, scalability, and user experience.

## Why do we need Jaeger Alternatives?

Jaeger is a powerful tool for distributed tracing, but it has its downsides, which may necessitate considering an alternative tool. Jaeger’s UI is limited, and you might need more capabilities for analyzing your trace data.

Another notable limitation is its narrow focus on distributed tracing. In today's complex software ecosystems, troubleshooting and resolving issues require more than just tracing requests across microservices. 

You need access to rich metrics that offer insights into system performance, resource utilization, and application behavior. Jaeger lacks observability features such as metrics collection, logging, and profiling. This means you may need to use additional tools alongside Jaeger to gather comprehensive observability data. Using multiple tools for monitoring is not easy and often requires more engineering bandwidth. 

Another limitation worth considering is the maintenance required for the databases supported by Jaeger. Currently, Jaeger supports Cassandra and Elasticsearch as its backends, but these databases require ongoing maintenance and may not scale as easily as other options. This can be a concern for teams that are looking for a more scalable and easier-to-maintain solution for their distributed tracing needs.
