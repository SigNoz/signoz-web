That calls for searching for Prometheus alternatives. While your options are many, you can narrow down your search by focusing on the ones that deliver superior performance, data ingestion, compression with high availability, and scalability. Let’s take a look at the top 11 tools.

## Why Look for Prometheus Alternatives?

Prometheus is a popular metrics monitoring tool. But there are many use cases where it might not be the best fit. Some scenarios where people look for Prometheus alternatives are:

- **Complex set up and issues in scaling** <br />
Some people find it complex to set up. Also, managing its scalability for very large and dynamic environments can become complex.
- **Not a fan of PromQL** <br />
Some users just don’t like PromQL, the query language of Prometheus for querying metrics.
- **More use cases than just Metrics monitoring** <br />
Prometheus is limited to metrics monitoring. Some users want to do more than metrics and don’t want to use multiple tools for their monitoring set up. SigNoz, an open-source Prometheus alternative can do logs, metrics, and traces under a single pane of glass.

We have created a list of 11 Prometheus alternatives that you can consider for your use-cases.
