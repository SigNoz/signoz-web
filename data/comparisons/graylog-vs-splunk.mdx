## Deployment Options

### Graylog: Flexible but Requires Setup

Graylog offers flexible deployment models suitable for both on-premises and cloud environments:

- **On-Premises**: Self-hosted on your infrastructure as Java services with Elasticsearch/OpenSearch and MongoDB
- **Cloud**: Can be deployed on cloud VMs or containerized (Docker/Kubernetes)
- **Managed Service**: Graylog Cloud for those who prefer SaaS

For production deployments, Graylog typically requires a cluster of nodes behind a load balancer and an Elasticsearch cluster for indexing. While a single instance is straightforward to set up, production clusters need careful planning.

Real-world examples include organizations handling over 1 TB/day of logs using Graylog in OpenStack environments. The platform scales horizontally as log volume grows, but requires expertise to manage effectively.

### Splunk: Powerful but Resource-Intensive

Splunk supports various deployment models with some complexity:

- **Self-Managed**: Installed on your servers (commonly Linux)
- **Cloud**: Splunk Cloud hosted on AWS/GCP
- **Hybrid**: On-premises forwarders with cloud indexing

Large Splunk deployments involve multiple components (forwarders, indexers, search heads) distributed across machines. This architecture can become complex—Splunk often recommends professional services for designing big deployments.

Splunk is not lightweight; each server can be resource-intensive (CPU, memory, storage I/O). Recent enhancements like SmartStore (which offloads index storage to S3) make it more cloud-friendly, but achieving elasticity in a cloud-native sense requires planning.

### SigNoz: Cloud-Native by Design

SigNoz was built with modern deployment patterns in mind:

- **Kubernetes-Native**: Distributed as Docker containers and Helm charts
- **Self-Hosted**: Can run on any K8s cluster or even Docker Compose for smaller setups
- **Managed Service**: SigNoz Cloud provides a fully managed SaaS option

Thanks to its modular architecture (collectors, query service, ClickHouse DB), SigNoz scales horizontally as demand increases. Getting it running on a Kubernetes cluster is relatively quick with one-line Helm installation and sensible defaults.

This cloud-native approach means teams can embed SigNoz into their infrastructure-as-code workflows (Terraform, Helm) and leverage container orchestration for scaling and resilience.

## Pricing Models and Total Cost of Ownership

The cost structures of these tools vary dramatically, which significantly impacts total cost of ownership (TCO), especially at scale.

### Graylog: Cost-Effective Open Source

- **Graylog Open**: Free to use (self-hosted)
- **Graylog Enterprise**: Based on daily ingest volume
  - 5 GB/day: Free
  - 20 GB/day: ~\$12K/year
  - 50 GB/day: ~\$20K/year
- **Graylog Cloud**: Starts at \$1,250/month for 10 GB/day

Organizations using Graylog Open only need to budget for infrastructure and maintenance. One team reported handling ~250GB/day of logs with Graylog on cloud VMs for about \$3.7K/month in infrastructure costs.

The "hidden" cost is the effort to manage it; high availability and scaling require expertise. However, for large-scale log data needs, Graylog's open-source model can drastically lower direct costs compared to commercial alternatives.

### Splunk: Premium Pricing

- **Traditional Licensing**: Based on peak daily data ingest
  - 100 GB/day: \$150K+/year
  - 600 GB/day: \$1M+/year
  - 3 TB/day: \$3.5M/year (reported by one organization)
- **Additional Costs**:
  - Add-ons (Enterprise Security, etc.): \$2K-\$4K/month
  - Infrastructure: \$10K-\$15K/month for cloud or on-prem resources

Splunk has introduced more nuanced pricing recently, including infrastructure-based pricing (per host) and workload-based pricing. However, for log management, volume-based pricing remains common and can become prohibitively expensive as data grows.

The total cost includes licensing, infrastructure (if self-managed), and potentially certified Splunk admins or consultants. Some justify the cost because Splunk might replace multiple tools (logs, SIEM, etc.) with one platform.

### SigNoz: Predictable and Scalable Costs

- **Open Source**: Free to run on your infrastructure
- **SigNoz Cloud**: Usage-based pricing
  - Starting at \$49/month
  - Logs & traces: \$0.30 per GB (15-day retention)
  - Metrics: \$0.10 per million samples (30-day retention)
- **SigNoz Enterprise**: Self-hosted with support, starting ~\$4K/month

For comparison, 100 GB of logs in SigNoz would cost about \$30, whereas in Splunk it could be hundreds of dollars. Because SigNoz uses efficient storage (ClickHouse), infrastructure costs may also be lower than Elasticsearch-based stacks for the same data volume.

This predictable cost model helps avoid the sudden budget spikes that can occur with Splunk's model when data volumes grow unexpectedly.

<KeyPointCallout title="Cost Comparison">
Processing 1 TB of logs daily could cost over \$1.5M annually with Splunk, around \$150K with Graylog Enterprise, and approximately \$90K with SigNoz Cloud (or just infrastructure costs if self-hosted).
</KeyPointCallout>

## Performance and Scalability

Handling high log ingestion rates and large volumes is crucial, especially in cloud environments where microservices generate massive logs during peak loads.

### Graylog: Proven at Scale with Proper Architecture

Graylog's performance is largely tied to its Elasticsearch backend. With proper tuning, it can handle substantial volumes:

- Real-world deployments report processing 1,600 log messages/sec with bursts up to 20,000/sec
- Deutsche Telekom ran Graylog for >1 TB/day across multiple data centers
- Search performance is excellent due to pre-indexing, with millisecond response times

Bottlenecks typically come from Elasticsearch (disk I/O, CPU for indexing) and memory for caching searches. Scaling involves adding more ES nodes or Graylog servers.

For cloud deployments, Graylog can leverage managed OpenSearch services and SSD storage. Using message queues (e.g., Kafka) as an ingest buffer helps smooth out traffic spikes.

### Splunk: Enterprise-Grade with Resource Requirements

Splunk is engineered for enormous data volumes but requires substantial resources:

- Large enterprises run Splunk on clusters of dozens of servers
- One Splunk Cloud deployment indexes 2.5 TB/day using 39 indexers and 3 search heads
- Indexers can ingest hundreds of GB per day per node with sufficient CPU and SSDs

Splunk's SmartStore feature stores warm/cold data in S3, using local disks mainly for hot data. This improves scalability but can impact search speed on older data.

Running Splunk in Kubernetes can yield performance improvements—Splunk reports a 50% increase in ingestion per server for some indexers moved to K8s due to better resource utilization.

### SigNoz: Modern Architecture for Efficiency

SigNoz leverages ClickHouse, a distributed columnar database optimized for analytics:

- Benchmark tests show SigNoz ingesting logs 2.5× faster than ELK stacks while using 50% fewer resources
- Query performance for aggregations is significantly faster than Elasticsearch
- Architecture is fully horizontal: add more ingest pods or ClickHouse nodes to scale

SigNoz can buffer data via Kafka to handle traffic spikes and uses backpressure to avoid being overwhelmed. It also offers retention control and tiered storage—configuring how long to keep high-resolution data and archiving older logs to cheaper storage.

While it may not yet have decades of tuning like Splunk in ultra-large deployments, SigNoz's technology stack is fundamentally scalable and resource-efficient—a good fit for cloud-native workloads where you want to maximize performance per CPU/dollar.

## User Experience and Interface

A tool's usability is crucial for quickly finding insights from logs. Each platform offers a distinct experience:

### Graylog UI: Simple and Focused

Graylog provides a clean, minimalist interface centered on log data:

- **Dashboard-Oriented**: View streams of log messages, search results, and widgets
- **Search-Focused**: Point-and-click creation of searches and filters, or direct Lucene queries
- **Collaboration Features**: Sharing saved searches and dashboards among team members

The UI emphasizes quick access to search and analysis functions. Users can define streams (filtered views of logs) and create dashboards with charts for metrics like log volume or error codes.

Graylog's interface for alert management is straightforward—configure conditions and notifications in a form-based UI. While less dynamic than Splunk, many users appreciate its uncluttered experience and the fact that basic keyword searches work without learning a proprietary query language.

### Splunk UI: Powerful but Complex

Splunk offers a feature-rich interface with extensive customization:

- **Search-Centric**: The search bar for SPL queries is central to the experience
- **Rich Visualizations**: Build dashboards with charts, maps, tables, and drill-down capabilities
- **App Ecosystem**: Different Splunk apps provide specialized interfaces (e.g., security dashboards)

Splunk's Dashboard Studio lets you place UI components freely and apply custom HTML/CSS if needed. This flexibility enables advanced analytics portals but contributes to a steep learning curve.

Navigation can be confusing initially with many screens (search, dashboards, alerts, settings, apps) and sub-menus. However, experienced users become efficient with features like saved searches, time range pickers, and field explorers.

### SigNoz UI: Modern and Integrated

SigNoz features a developer-friendly interface that unifies logs, metrics, and traces:

- **Unified Navigation**: Easily jump from metrics to related logs or from traces to error logs
- **Pre-Built Visualizations**: Flame graphs and timeline charts for tracing, dashboards for metrics
- **Intuitive Filtering**: Log view with field filtering, full-text search, and structured log support

The UI emphasizes reducing clicks to reach relevant data. For example, you might spot a spike in error rates on a dashboard, drill down to the trace of a failing request, and then view the exact error log—all within the same interface.

New users find SigNoz easier to learn because it doesn't require a proprietary query language for basic use. The interface continues to evolve rapidly with community contributions focusing on usability improvements.

<KeyPointCallout title="UX Comparison">
