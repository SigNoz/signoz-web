Now let's dive deep into what infrastructure monitoring involves and explore each tool in detail.

## What is Infrastructure Monitoring?

Infrastructure monitoring is the process of collecting, tracking, and analyzing health and performance metrics across an enterprise’s IT infrastructure components, such as the servers, networks, databases, apps, and services. Continuous infrastructure monitoring helps enterprises detect anomalies proactively and prevent surprises (e.g. sudden downtimes or latency issues). It enables timely response to performance degradation, minimizing service disruptions and preventing customer churn.

### What are Infrastructure Monitoring Tools?

Infrastructure monitoring tools are software solutions designed to collect, track, and analyze the performance and health of IT infrastructure components, such as servers, networks, databases, and applications. Continuous infrastructure monitoring help organizations proactively detect anomalies, prevent downtime, and ensure optimal performance of their IT environment.

## Choosing an Infrastructure Monitoring Solution

When choosing an infrastructure monitoring tool, the following are key considerations to keep in mind to ensure that it meets your needs.

### 1. Integration and Resource Discovery

Choose a tool that integrates seamlessly with your stack, including containers, databases, orchestration tools, cloud infrastructure monitoring, and serverless functions. It should automatically discover and scrape metrics from autoscaled resources and scale with your organization without compromising performance.

### 2. Comprehensive Data Collection

Consider a tool that collects diverse data—performance metrics, logs, traces, and user experience data—from all backend components. It should correlate telemetry types and match telemetry to corresponding infrastructure for a holistic view, enabling swift detection of performance issues.


### 3. Real-time Monitoring and Alerting

The tool should offer real-time insights into CPU usage, disk space, network latency, response times, failed requests, error rates, etc., with instant detection and alerting on issues like packet drops or excessive pod scheduling for proactive issue resolution.


### 4. Customization and User-friendly Interface

Look for customizable dashboards that provide quick overviews and visual representations of infrastructure components. The tool should allow alerting thresholds for metrics and have a user-friendly interface for easy setup, navigation, and access to metadata.


### 5. Automation and Remediation

Choose a tool that offers automated remediation options to streamline routine tasks, save time, increase accuracy, and reduce the impact of incidents.


### 6. AI and ML Capabilities

Advanced tools should use AI and ML to analyze data trends, predict potential issues, and provide intelligent insights to support decision-making.

### 7. Security and Compliance

Ensure the tool offers robust security features, particularly encryption, to protect data and ensure compliance with regulations like SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.
