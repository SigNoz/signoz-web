Both New Relic and AppDynamics are observability and monitoring tools that provide insights into the performance and health of applications, infrastructure, and services. 

New Relic is a cloud-based observability platform that provides real-time analytics, distributed tracing, and application performance monitoring (APM) capabilities. AppDynamics, on the other hand, is a full-stack application performance management (APM) solution that offers deep insights into application performance, user experience, and business performance.

### Key features of New Relic

- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)** <br/>
    
    New Relic provides robust APM capabilities, offering real-time insights into application performance and user experience. It enables teams to quickly identify and resolve performance issues.
    
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**<br/>
    
    New Relic's RUM feature captures detailed insights into user interactions, providing real-time analytics for understanding and optimizing the user experience.
    
- **Dashboards and Visualizations**<br/>
    
    New Relic has an intuitive UI and comes with pre-configured monitoring dashboards. It also allows for the creation of custom dashboards to monitor important metrics. Additionally, it offers a range of visualization options for understanding and analyzing application data efficiently.
    
- **Incident Alerting**<br/>
    
    New Relic‚Äôs incident alerting feature quickly notifies teams about performance anomalies, allowing for immediate resolution.
    

### What is AppDynamics?

AppDynamics is a comprehensive full-stack observability and monitoring platform used by organizations to ensure the optimal performance and reliability of their software applications. It provides a wide range of tools for performance management and IT Operations analytics, offering visibility across all infrastructure components, including networks, servers, and containers. It also supports application performance monitoring, database monitoring, SAP monitoring, and end-user monitoring, enabling businesses to identify performance bottlenecks, monitor production environments, and understand user experiences with their products. AppDynamics is optimized for production environments to ensure minimal performance overhead.

### Key Features of AppDynamics

- **End-User Monitoring**<br/>
    
    AppDynamics end-user monitoring feature offers visibility into how users interact with applications from various devices, browsers, and locations for optimizing application performance accordingly.
    
- **Dashboards and Visualizations**<br/>
    
    AppDynamics also allows for the creation of custom dashboards, but it allows for more customization and 
    
- **Application Performance Monitoring**<br/>
    
    AppDynamics enables real-time monitoring of both business and application performance. It includes an auto-discovery feature that automatically identifies and displays the status of connected devices and applications. This feature uses color-coding to visually indicate the health status of each component, allowing for quick identification of any faults or issues.
    
- **Synthetic monitoring**<br/>
    
    AppDynamics' Synthetic Monitoring feature is designed to actively test applications by simulating user behavior, thereby establishing baselines and measuring performance in a controlled environment.
    

## New Relic vs AppDynamics: Key Differences

- **Application Security**<br/>
    
    New Relic offers features focused on application security such as real-time threat detection, application security monitoring, and compliance reporting. On the other hand, AppDynamics provides robust application security features including runtime application self-protection (RASP), code-level security insights, and advanced anomaly detection to identify and mitigate security threats in real-time.
    
- **Pricing**<br/>
    
    New Relic utilizes a user-based pricing model where the cost is determined by the number of users or licenses purchased. This is quite expensive but is generally considered more affordable in contrast to AppDynamics. New Relic provides a free forever plan with 100 GB of free data ingest per month for users looking to test the platform.
    
    AppDynamics uses an <a href = "https://www.appdynamics.com/pricing#~cisco-appdynamics" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >SKU pricing model</a> which is based on licensed units per CPU Core, with different packages available to cater to various needs, including Infrastructure Monitoring, Premium, and Enterprise packages. The pricing can immediately get expensive considering the cost of monitoring a large number of CPU Cores. AppDynamics doesn‚Äôt provide a free forever plan like New Relic but it offers a free 15-day trial period for users to explore the platform before committing to a purchase.
    
- **Synthetic monitoring**<br/>
    
    AppDynamics does synthetic monitoring better than New Relic this is because New Relic collects data from real users only while AppDynamics collects data from both real users and synthetic users. This dual data collection method enhances the accuracy and reliability of performance insights, identifying and addressing potential issues before they impact end users.
