/>

### Privacy Concerns:

Sentry recently faced backlash after announcing TOS changes that allowed using customer data to train AI models without an opt-out option.

This sparked concerns, especially in healthcare and other regulated industries, about risks to data privacy, HIPAA compliance, intellectual property (IP), and personally identifiable information (PII).

Although Sentry retracted the changes and committed to clearer consent mechanisms, the incident eroded trust, leaving organizations questioning its alignment with long-term data security needs.

### Pricing Changes:

Beyond privacy, Sentry’s pricing has also been a pain point for some users. For growing startups or teams scaling their applications, the cost of Sentry’s plans can add up quickly. This has pushed companies to explore alternatives that offer more flexible pricing models or better value for their needs.

### Feature Limitations for Advanced Use Cases:

Features like distributed tracing are available but may not match the depth of dedicated observability tools, limiting Sentry's utility for complex microservices debugging. Its focus on error tracking over full observability can make it less suitable for broader application performance monitoring.

### Customization and Integration Boundaries:

While Sentry APIs offer flexibility, rate limits on API calls (e.g., 500 API calls per minute on free plans) can hinder integration with high-frequency workflows. Additionally, plugins for less common tech stacks may lack support or require custom development, making integrations with niche tools more challenging.

### Scalability:

Sentry's performance may degrade under extreme event volumes.

For instance, a social media platform during a viral event, where millions of users are posting and interacting at once, could generate millions of error events per second, such as failed API calls or server crashes. This massive surge in error events can strain the system’s resources and require additional infrastructure to handle the load effectively.

In self-hosted setups, scaling requires configuring additional worker nodes, Redis instances, and Kafka clusters, which adds operational complexity.

These factors have increased demand for alternatives that offer similar functionality with added benefits. The search for Sentry alternatives is particularly crucial for:

### Highly Regulated Industries:

Organizations in sectors like healthcare, finance, and government are bound by strict regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR. These industries need tools that not only ensure compliance but also provide detailed written assurances, third-party audit reports, and advanced security features like encryption and access control.

Sentry’s past changes to its Terms of Service, combined with a lack of explicit compliance guarantees for sensitive data, make it less appealing to organizations prioritizing regulatory adherence and data privacy.

### Large Enterprises:

Enterprises require full-stack observability platforms that can integrate seamlessly across diverse systems, support hybrid or on-premises deployments, and deliver advanced analytics.

Sentry’s primary focus on error tracking limits its ability to meet the needs of large organizations seeking comprehensive operational insights, cross-team collaboration features, and support for complex multi-region infrastructures. Its scalability options may also fall short in handling enterprise-grade workloads efficiently.

### Open-Source Advocates:

Teams that favor open-source tools value transparency, flexibility, and the ability to modify the codebase according to their requirements. While Sentry’s open-source offering is robust, its commercial version often introduces restrictions that limit customizability.

Open-source advocates may also seek alternatives that foster a stronger sense of community involvement and avoid dependency on a single vendor’s roadmap.

### Startups:

Startups require error-tracking tools that are both cost-effective and scalable, catering to their dynamic growth stages. Features like usage-based pricing, flexible plans, and transparent cost structures are critical. Sentry’s pricing model charges based on event volume. This structure can become expensive for startups, especially those dealing with high-frequency, low-priority errors.

Additionally, startups may need lightweight tools with simple setups, proactive alerts, and integration support tailored for modern DevOps workflows—areas where Sentry might not fully deliver.

### Comparison to Sentry

SigNoz offers comparable error tracking features with the added advantages of full observability and complete data control. While Sentry delivers a more refined out-of-the-box experience, SigNoz provides greater flexibility and significant cost savings as your needs scale. Its backend operates on Kafka+Druid or the OLAP database ClickHouse, with the query service built in Go and a front-end powered by TypeScript.

1. Pricing
   - Pricing Model
     SigNoz relies on a usage-based pricing approach starting at $199/month, with additional charges based on data usage: $0.3/GB for logs and traces and $0.1/million metric samples whereas sentry utilizes an event-based pricing structure starting at $29/month for 100,000 events. The cost scales with event volume and user count, making it less predictable.
   - Cost Predictability
     SigNoz’s transparent pricing tied directly to usage ensures predictable costs, even as data scales. Teams benefit from clarity and better budget control whereas for sentry the per-event and per-user pricing can lead to unexpected cost increases, especially for high-volume teams.
   - Example Scenario
     For a team processing:
     - Logs and Traces: 2GB per day (60GB/month).
     - Metrics: 10 million samples per day (300 million samples/month).
     ```
     Cost Calculations
     Cost Structure: Base + Traces + Metrics = Total Cost
     SigNoz: $199 (base) + (60GB × $0.3) + (300M × $0.1) = $247/month.
     Sentry: $26 (base) + (60GB x $0.22) + [(300M x $ varying cost above 10M) = $382] = $421.2/month
     ```

  alt="LogRocket dashboard"
  caption="LogRocket dashboard"
/>

LogRocket offers more detailed user-centric error context than Sentry but may be less comprehensive for back-end error tracking.

1.  Pricing
    - Pricing Model:
      LogRocket uses a session-based pricing model, starting at $69/month for 10,000 sessions. Sentry, on the other hand, adopts an event-based pricing model, where costs increase based on the number of events and users, making it harder to predict expenses.
    - Cost Predictability:
      LogRocket provides a straightforward model where costs scale with session volume, ensuring better budgeting clarity. In contrast, Sentry’s costs can become unpredictable as event counts grow, potentially leading to unexpected fees.
    - Value for Investment:
      LogRocket offers advanced features like session replay and AI-driven struggle detection even in its lower-tier plans, delivering significant value from the start. Sentry requires additional setup for features like incident management, which can increase the overall costs.
    - Scalability and Flexibility:
      LogRocket scales with your team’s needs, maintaining a clear and manageable cost structure. Sentry’s event-based pricing may not scale as effectively, particularly for teams with fluctuating event volumes.
2.  Instrumentation and performance overhead
    LogRocket's Mobile SDK optimizes app performance by minimizing its impact across several key metrics. It ensures screen capture on the main thread takes less than 16 milliseconds per frame, capturing the screen only once per second.
    Bandwidth usage is kept low at an average of 10KB per second, while data is temporarily stored during offline periods. Disk usage is optimized through efficient I/O cycles, and app start times are categorized into Cold `(<5s)`, Warm `(<2s)`, and Hot `(<1.5s)` starts, adhering to Google’s recommendations, with visual indicators in purple or red highlighting performance compliance.

        For mobile sessions, LogRocket tracks real-time network throughput, memory usage every 10 seconds, and CPU usage above ~10%. It also flags frozen frames, indicating those taking over 700ms to render. This comprehensive monitoring provides granular insights into performance without compromising app responsiveness.

3.  Data and Efficiency

    - Data Architecture
      LogRocket’s architecture is designed to provide a holistic view of user interactions and frontend performance metrics, making it ideal for tracking the user journey and UI/UX issues. It integrates seamlessly with frontend frameworks, enabling session replay and performance analysis.
      In contrast, Sentry focuses on error tracking and event aggregation, excelling at debugging but lacking the detailed insights into user behavior and frontend performance that LogRocket provides. LogRocket’s session replay and performance tracking offer a more comprehensive view of the user experience compared to Sentry’s error-centric design.
    - Bandwidth Efficiency
      LogRocket optimizes bandwidth by using protocol buffers (protobufs), a compact binary format that reduces data transmission size and keeps usage around 10KB per second during real-time recording. This makes it efficient in bandwidth-constrained environments.
      Sentry, on the other hand, uses JSON, a text-based format that tends to be more verbose and consumes more bandwidth, especially when handling large volumes of data. LogRocket’s use of protocol buffers ensures a more efficient, lower-bandwidth solution compared to Sentry’s JSON-based transmission.
    - Device Storage Management
      LogRocket manages device storage effectively by temporarily caching event data before uploading it, preventing excessive storage use and optimizing I/O cycles. This approach ensures the app’s performance remains unaffected while reducing the strain on device storage.
      In comparison, Sentry primarily focuses on error logs, and although it offers options for controlling data retention, it lacks the proactive storage management strategy that LogRocket employs for frontend performance data. LogRocket’s caching system provides more efficient device storage management compared to Sentry’s error storage.

4.  Customizations and integrations

- User Session Recording and Replay: LogRocket allows developers to record and replay user sessions, offering an in-depth view of user interactions and technical issues. This feature is valuable for reproducing and resolving customer-reported problems.
- Quality Adjustment Through Circuit-Breakers: LogRocket automatically adjusts the recording quality in response to unusual behavior (e.g., overloaded Redux state, excessive console logs). This ensures that app performance is protected while still capturing necessary data.
- Performance Optimization via Asynchronous Loading: LogRocket uses asynchronous loading of resources, which helps to avoid slowing down page load times. It loads a minimal, compressed script first, deferring the rest of the resources until essential components are ready.
- Offloading Processing to Worker Threads: To minimize the presence on the main thread, LogRocket offloads most processing to a worker thread, allowing the app to remain responsive while still tracking key events like DOM mutations and user interactions.

            Sentry captures real-time errors and performance issues during user interactions but does not mention sampling explicitly.

        - Scalability and Flexibility

            Jaeger's architecture is built to scale efficiently, especially for large volumes of trace data in microservices environments.

            Sentry is designed for error tracking and performance monitoring, with less emphasis on handling massive trace volumes compared to Jaeger.

4.  Customizations and integrations
    - Customizability
      Jaeger offers a highly customizable and extensible platform, allowing developers to configure the system according to their specific needs. One of its key strengths is the ability to adjust the sampling rate, enabling developers to control the amount of data captured.
      On the other hand, Sentry provides a simpler configuration that focuses primarily on error tracking, with fewer customization options for distributed tracing. While Sentry supports custom error grouping and basic issue tracking, it lacks the deep configurability Jaeger offers for handling tracing data at scale, especially in complex environments like Kubernetes.
    - Integration with OpenTelemetry
      Jaeger operates independently but can be integrated with the OpenTelemetry Collector, which can run as a sidecar, host agent/daemon, or central cluster. The OpenTelemetry Collector supports Jaeger's Remote Sampling protocol, which allows it to either serve static configurations directly from config files or proxy requests to the Jaeger backend for adaptive sampling.
      This integration simplifies SDK configuration by pointing both trace export and sampling endpoints to a local host, eliminating the need for remote service discovery. It also enables data enrichment, such as adding Kubernetes pod names, and distributes the resource load for enrichment across all application hosts, though it introduces overhead due to marshaling and unmarshaling data.
      In contrast, Sentry integrates with external tools for alerts and notifications but lacks the same level of flexibility and integration with OpenTelemetry. Sentry does not support the advanced data enrichment capabilities or intricate integration features that Jaeger offers, especially when dealing with distributed systems.

      />
    - Distributed Tracing
      Jaeger excels with its advanced configurability, particularly in large-scale and complex environments like Kubernetes. It offers features such as remote and adaptive sampling, which can fine-tune the tracing process to ensure that only relevant data is collected. This flexibility makes it suitable for teams that need detailed control over their tracing data.
      On the other hand, Sentry is focused mainly on error tracking and grouping based on error patterns. While it provides basic performance monitoring and release tracking, it does not offer the same in-depth distributed tracing features as Jaeger, limiting its capabilities for complex tracing scenarios.
5.  Security and compliance

    | Aspect     | Jaeger                                  | Sentry                         |
    | ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
    | Encryption | Relies on underlying storage encryption | End-to-end encryption for data |
    | RBAC       | Limited, depends on hosting environment | Basic RBAC capabilities        |
    | Compliance | Dependent on hosting setup              | SOC 2, GDPR                    |

    Jaeger is an excellent choice for teams focused on distributed tracing in microservices, while Sentry serves as a great complement for tracking errors, performance anomalies, and overall application health. Together, they can provide a comprehensive observability solution for modern applications.

         Datadog’s synthetic monitoring allows it to identify and address potential performance problems before they impact end users.
         Sentry, by comparison, excels in diagnosing issues after they occur but doesn’t provide the same level of early-stage performance tuning.
    3. Data Architecture
       - Backend Architecture
         Datadog employs a managed backend with a proprietary ingestion pipeline optimized for scalability, making it ideal for high-throughput environments but leading to higher costs for data retention and querying.
         Sentry uses a ClickHouse-based storage engine for efficient event data storage and querying, with a self-hosted option that provides more control but requires significant resources for scaling, particularly in large environments.
       - Suitability for Use Cases
         Datadog excels in high-throughput environments where infrastructure-level metrics and large-scale data ingestion are essential, thanks to its managed backend and scalability.
         Sentry is more focused on application-level error events, making it less suitable for infrastructure-level metrics or handling large-scale data environments like Datadog.
       - Flexibility and Control
         Datadog offers a fully managed solution, providing ease of use and automatic scalability but less control over backend configurations.
         Sentry provides the option for self-hosting, offering greater control over storage and scaling strategies, though this adds management complexity
    4. Customizations and integrations
       - Incident Management:
         Datadog offers a comprehensive incident management suite with flexible alerting and manual/automatic incident declaration, but lacks advanced features like on-call scheduling and complex escalations.
         While sentry simplifies incident management by treating each new issue as an incident and allows custom issue handling, acknowledging, resolving, and defining code ownership and notification workflows. It lacks advanced features like on-call scheduling or phone-based alerting.
       - Alert Configuration:
         Datadog provides a customizable alerting system with variables and rules, offering more complex configurations.
         Sentry’s features a more straightforward, click-based alert configuration with conditional statements, but lacks advanced alerting options.
       - CI/CD Integration:
         Datadog provides extensive CI/CD integrations, such as deployment tracking, custom error grouping, and support for IaC tools like Terraform.
         Sentry, primarily focuses on error tracking and reporting within the development pipeline, offering advanced error grouping algorithms but fewer CI/CD hooks and APIs than Datadog.

For high-traffic applications, tools offering unlimited events with flat-rate pricing might be cost-effective. Consider whether the tool offers tiered pricing or pay-as-you-go plans that align with your usage patterns.
       - Hidden Costs: Look for potential additional expenses, such as charges for data retention extensions, API usage, or integration with external tools like Slack or PagerDuty.
         Be mindful of potential "gotchas" like fees for advanced features, historical data access, or additional storage beyond the basic plan.
       - Trial Period: Try to opt for tools that provide a free trial or tier, allowing you to evaluate their features without commitment. This can help you test scalability, usability, and integration capabilities before fully committing.
    3. Integration & Ecosystem Fit
       - CI/CD Integration: Ensure the tool integrates seamlessly with your continuous integration and deployment pipelines. For example, check compatibility with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD for tracking deployment-specific issues.
         Also, verify whether the tool supports version control systems for automatic release tracking and issue linking.
       - Observability Suite: Verify that the error tracker can complement your existing observability stack. Look for out-of-the-box support for metrics and logging correlation, and check if the tool integrates well with monitoring platforms like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog.
       - Automation Support: Ensure the tool provides robust APIs or SDKs for automating workflows, such as custom alerts or automated ticket creation in systems like Jira or Trello.
         Additionally, check whether the tool supports webhooks to integrate with other alerting or notification systems.
    4. Data Privacy & Compliance
       - Regulatory Adherence: Verify the solution complies with regulatory frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA. This is especially crucial if your application handles sensitive user data. Ensure the vendor provides details about their compliance certifications and regularly updated audit reports.
       - Data Residency: Check if the tool allows you to specify data storage locations to meet local data residency requirements. Confirm if the solution supports multiple regions or cloud providers for better control over data sovereignty.
       - Anonymization Features: Ensure it provides capabilities to redact or mask sensitive data from logs and error traces. Look for configurable settings that can automatically remove or obfuscate personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data points.
    5. Support & Community
       - Documentation Quality: Evaluate the depth and clarity of the documentation. Look for comprehensive guides, API references, and troubleshooting sections. Ideally, documentation should be frequently updated with examples and real-world use cases.
       - Support Channels: Check the availability of support through live chat, email, or dedicated account managers for enterprise-level plans. Also, assess the availability of service-level agreements (SLAs) for support response times, especially for critical issues.
       - Community Engagement: Look for an active user community or forums where you can get quick resolutions for common issues. Open-source tools often have strong GitHub communities for reporting bugs and sharing plugins.
         You should also assess the vendor’s involvement in online communities or forums, as this can indicate the level of investment in customer satisfaction.

      alt="Migrating from sentry"
      caption="Migrating from sentry"
    />

    Transitioning from Sentry to a new error-tracking solution involves technical considerations that ensure continuity, accuracy, and efficiency in error-tracking processes. Here's a detailed guide:

    1. Data Export & Import:

       - Export Data from Sentry: You can export Discover query results as a `.csv` file by following these steps:

         1. Go to the Discover page and choose the data source: Errors or Transactions.

            <Figure
              src="/img/comparisons/2025/01/sentry-alternatives-image%2020.webp"
              alt=""
              caption=""
            />
            2. Refine the results using the search bar.

            <Figure
              src="/img/comparisons/2025/01/sentry-alternatives-image%2021.webp"
              alt=""
              caption=""
            />
            3. Select the desired columns using the Columns button.

            <Figure
              src="/img/comparisons/2025/01/sentry-alternatives-image%2022.webp"
              alt=""
              caption=""
            />
            4. Click on Export all.

            Once the data is ready, Sentry will send a download link to your primary email address. Alternatively, you can use the Open in Discover button from the issues or performance pages and then click Export all.

            <Figure
              src="/img/comparisons/2025/01/sentry-alternatives-image%2023.webp"
              alt="Sentry Export All feature"
              caption="Sentry Export All feature"
            />{' '}

            Note: This feature is available only for organizations on the Business or Enterprise plan.

       - Import to the New Tool: Verify if your chosen error tracking solution supports direct import of Sentry data. For example, some tools provide scripts or APIs to map and ingest Sentry's JSON export format.
         If no direct importer exists, write a custom script to transform the exported data into the required format using Python, Node.js, or your preferred language.

    2. Integration Updates:

       - Remove Sentry SDK: Locate and remove all references to the Sentry SDK from your codebase. This includes initialization calls (e.g., `Sentry.init()`), breadcrumb captures, and context updates. Use your build tools (like `grep`, `ripgrep`, or IDE search) to find and clean up Sentry-related code.
       - Integrate New SDK: Install the new error tracking tool's SDK (e.g., OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and error monitoring). Follow the documentation to configure it, including initialization, contextual data injection, and setting up custom spans for better observability.
         For example, in Python, you might use `pip install opentelemetry-distro` and configure it in your application startup files.
       - Update Custom Logic: Migrate any custom logic like user session tracking, filtering sensitive information, or sending alerts to the new tool’s APIs.
         For instance, suppose your application tracks user sessions in Sentry using `Sentry.setContext()`
         you can migrate this functionality to a new tool like say `NewTracker`

         ```python
         sentry_sdk.init(dsn="your-sentry-dsn")

         sentry_sdk.set_context("user", {
             "id": "12345",
             "email": "user@example.com",
             "role": "admin"
         })

         sentry_sdk.capture_message("User performed an admin action")
         ```

         Now, in your `NewTracker` you can update this custom logic as

         ```python
         new_tracker.init(api_key="your-newtracker-api-key")

         new_tracker.set_metadata({
             "user": {
                 "id": "12345",
                 "email": "user@example.com",
                 "role": "admin"
             }
         })

         new_tracker.log_event("User performed an admin action", level="info")
         ```

    3. Team Training:
       - Hands-On Tutorials: Provide step-by-step training to familiarize your team with the new tool's dashboard, alerting mechanisms, and error tracking features. Use sandbox environments for live demonstrations.
       - Internal Documentation: Write internal guides specific to your workflows. Include details like how to triage errors, customize dashboards, and integrate alerts with tools like Slack, or Microsoft Teams.
    4. Staged Rollout:

       - Parallel Monitoring: Initially run Sentry alongside the new error tracker to benchmark their outputs. Use this phase to identify gaps in data collection or discrepancies in error reporting. Tools like `tcpdump` or `Wireshark` can help analyze network traffic for API discrepancies.
         Following the example, we’ve used of `NewTracker` above let’s see an example where we send error data to both Sentry and `NewTracker` for comparison:

         ```python
         sentry_sdk.init(dsn="your-sentry-dsn")
         new_tracker.init(api_key="your-newtracker-api-key")

         def track_error(error_message, error_context):
             sentry_sdk.set_context("error_context", error_context)
             sentry_sdk.capture_message(error_message)

             new_tracker.set_metadata({"error_context": error_context})
             new_tracker.log_event(error_message, level="error")

         try:
             1 / 0
         except ZeroDivisionError as e:
             error_context = {"type": "ZeroDivisionError", "details": str(e)}
             track_error("An error occurred: Division by zero", error_context)
         ```

       - Gradual Transition: Migrate a subset of your application services to the new tool first, starting with non-critical ones. Validate that the tool captures and processes logs, traces, and metrics accurately before scaling up.
       - Automated Validation: Set up automated tests to verify that the new tool captures expected exceptions, logs, and contextual information. For example, use unit tests to simulate errors and ensure the expected error metadata is recorded in the new system.

    ### Migrating from Sentry to SigNoz

    <Figure
      src="/img/comparisons/2025/01/sentry-alternatives-image%2024.webp"
      alt="Exception Monitoring with SigNoz"
      caption="Exception Monitoring with SigNoz"
    />

    If you've chosen SigNoz as your Sentry alternative, follow these steps:

    1. Set Up SigNoz

       Begin by choosing the appropriate deployment model for SigNoz. If you opt for the cloud offering, simply create an account and follow the onboarding process.

       For the self-hosted option, ensure you have the required infrastructure and install SigNoz using its Docker Compose or Helm chart setup. Verify that the platform is running correctly by checking its user interface and initial metrics.

    2. Integrate OpenTelemetry SDK

       OpenTelemetry serves as the backbone for SigNoz. Select the OpenTelemetry SDK for your application’s programming language and integrate it following SigNoz's language-specific documentation.

       This involves configuring the SDK to send trace and error data to SigNoz. Include instrumentation for critical application components such as HTTP requests, database queries, and custom spans to ensure comprehensive monitoring.

       Here are some popular language-specific OpenTelemetry instrumentation guides to help you get started:

       1. [OpenTelemetry Python Instrumentation](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/python/)
       2. [OpenTelemetry Javascript Instrumentation](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/javascript/)
       3. [OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/java/)
       4. [OpenTelemetry Go Instrumentation](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/golang/)
       5. [OpenTelemetry PHP Instrumentation](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/php/)

       and many [more](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/overview/).

    3. Match Error Capturing

       When migrating from Sentry to SigNoz, it's important to match errors correctly. SigNoz ties errors to traces and spans, so you need to ensure that error events from Sentry align with the new tracing context in SigNoz for accurate tracking.

       When comparing error capturing between Sentry and SigNoz, the key difference lies in their integration and focus areas. Sentry captures errors using its SDK through the `capture_exception` method, which either accepts a caught exception directly or relies on the current exception from `sys.exc_info()`. This method sends exceptions as events to Sentry’s backend for analysis and storage, offering rich debugging information like stack traces and breadcrumbs.

       On the other hand, SigNoz, built on OpenTelemetry, captures errors within the context of traces. It uses the `record_exception` method to convert exceptions into span events, associating errors directly with a specific trace.

       Additionally, SigNoz updates the span status to reflect the failure, providing a more comprehensive context for observability that includes not only error reporting but also tracing and metrics.

       While Sentry is primarily geared towards error monitoring and debugging with minimal setup, SigNoz provides a unified observability framework that combines error capturing, tracing, and metrics for deeper insights into application performance and failure.

    4. Create Custom Dashboards

       Recreate your most-used Sentry views in SigNoz. Use its dashboarding tools to design custom panels that provide insights into error frequency, response times, and affected users. Tailor these dashboards to align with your team's workflows, ensuring minimal disruption during the transition.

    5. Set Up Alerts

       Replicate critical notifications from Sentry in SigNoz by setting up alerts. Define thresholds for error rates, latency, and other key metrics, and configure alerting channels such as email, Slack, or PagerDuty. Test the alerts to ensure they trigger correctly and provide actionable information.

    6. Staged Migration

       Gradually shift your team’s focus to SigNoz for error analysis. Start by monitoring both platforms in parallel, allowing your team to familiarize themselves with SigNoz while keeping Sentry as a fallback.

       Compare the data captured by both tools to identify gaps or discrepancies. Once confident, fully transition to SigNoz and decommission Sentry.

    7. Train Your Team

       Provide your team with tutorials and training sessions on using SigNoz. Focus on navigating the interface, interpreting metrics, and leveraging OpenTelemetry for custom tracing.

       Create internal documentation to ensure new team members can quickly adapt to the new system.

    8. Monitor and Optimize

       Post-migration, regularly review your SigNoz setup to optimize its performance. Analyze metrics and feedback to fine-tune dashboards, alerts, and instrumentation.

       Stay updated on SigNoz's latest features to continuously enhance your monitoring capabilities.
