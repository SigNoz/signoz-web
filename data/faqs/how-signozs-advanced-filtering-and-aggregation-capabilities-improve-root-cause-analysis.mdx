SigNoz is an open-source observability platform that helps you perform root cause analysis using advanced filtering and aggregation. With a unified view of metrics, logs, and traces, you can quickly identify and resolve performance issues.

## Advanced Filtering

The [**Query Builder**](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/) in SigNoz lets you apply advanced filters to logs and traces. You can filter by service name, response time, error rates, and more, allowing you to focus on relevant data points when diagnosing issues.

Key features:

- **Attribute-Based Filtering**: Filter data by specific attributes, like tags or labels, to pinpoint where issues occur.
- **Multiple Queries**: The Query Builder supports running multiple independent queries simultaneously, allowing users to analyze different dimensions of their data in parallel.

## Aggregation Capabilities

[Aggregation in SigNoz](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/#histogram-and-time-series-visualizations-) helps you summarize large data sets efficiently. You can apply functions like average, sum, count, and percentiles over specific time intervals or groups to derive meaningful insights.

Key features:

- **Group By**: Group data by attributes (e.g., service name) to analyze performance across different segments.
- **Time-Based Aggregation**: Aggregate data over time to visualize trends, helping you spot spikes in latency or errors.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Use flamegraphs and Gantt charts to visualize trace data and identify bottlenecks.

## Correlation of Data

SigNoz [correlates metrics, logs, and traces](https://signoz.io/opentelemetry/correlating-traces-logs-metrics-nodejs/) to give you a holistic view of system interactions.

- When you detect a latency spike, access related logs and traces to determine if the issue is due to a database query or network failure.
- [Automated anomaly detection](https://signoz.io/blog/introducing-anomaly-detection-for-smarter-alerts/) flags unusual patterns, helping you find root causes faster.

In summary, SigNoz's filtering, aggregation, and correlation capabilities make root cause analysis more efficient. With detailed queries, efficient data summarization, and seamless correlation, SigNoz helps you resolve issues faster and improve system reliability.
