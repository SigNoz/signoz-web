SigNoz integrates effectively with existing Prometheus setups, facilitating a smooth transition for users looking to enhance their monitoring capabilities. Here are the key aspects of this integration:

## Compatibility with Prometheus

- **Support for Prometheus Exporters**: [SigNoz is compatible with all Prometheus exporters](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-collector-prometheus-receiver/), allowing users to leverage the extensive ecosystem of metrics collection that Prometheus provides. This ensures that metrics collected from existing Prometheus instances can be easily scraped and utilized within SigNoz.
- **PromQL Support**: [SigNoz offers full support for PromQL](https://signoz.io/docs/faqs/product/#q-is-prometheus-included-in-signoz), which enables users to write queries and configure alerts using the familiar syntax they are accustomed to from Prometheus. This feature simplifies the migration process for teams transitioning from Prometheus to SigNoz.

## Enhanced Monitoring Features

- **Unified Observability**: By integrating with SigNoz, users gain access to a comprehensive monitoring platform that combines various telemetry types (metrics, logs, traces) in one interface. This holistic view aids in identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing resource utilization.
- **Advanced Alerting**: SigNoz enhances alert management by allowing dynamic configuration through APIs, which provides greater flexibility compared to traditional Prometheus alerting setups.

In summary, SigNoz not only works well with existing Prometheus setups but also enhances them by providing additional features and capabilities that improve overall observability and monitoring efficiency.
