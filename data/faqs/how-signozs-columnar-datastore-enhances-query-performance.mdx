SigNoz uses a **columnar datastore**, specifically ClickHouse, to boost query performance for observability tasks. This setup is ideal for managing large amounts of telemetry data, including metrics, traces, and logs.

## Key Benefits of Using ClickHouse

### 1. Fast Aggregation and Filtering

ClickHouse’s columnar design enables extremely fast aggregation. SigNoz can handle analytical queries up to [**1000 times faster**](https://signoz.io/log-management/) than traditional row-based databases. This speed is vital for real-time analytics and troubleshooting, helping you quickly gain insights.

### 2. Efficient Data Handling

Columnar databases handle [high cardinality data](https://signoz.io/blog/high-cardinality-data/) well, even when dealing with many unique values. This makes it easier for SigNoz to process complex queries involving [grouping and filtering](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/#aggregation-and-grouping-), like those using `GROUP BY`. You can perform operations like sum, count, and averages on large datasets with low latency.

### 3. Seamless User Experience

SigNoz integrates metrics, traces, and logs in a single application. This unified approach reduces the need for multiple tools ([like Grafana with Loki and Tempo](https://signoz.io/product-comparison/signoz-vs-grafana/)), letting you easily switch between different telemetry data types. For example, if you notice a latency spike, you can quickly access related traces with just one click.

### 4. Advanced Query Capabilities

The platform includes a [powerful query builder](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/) that simplifies log queries, even if you’re not familiar with complex query languages. You can easily apply filters and aggregations through an intuitive interface, making it accessible for both developers and operators.

### 5. Optimized Storage and Cost Efficiency

ClickHouse also improves storage efficiency with features like data compression and partitioning. This lowers [storage costs](https://signoz.io/pricing/) while maintaining high performance during data ingestion and querying. SigNoz effectively manages long-term storage, meeting compliance and auditing needs without sacrificing speed.

By leveraging ClickHouse, SigNoz transforms how you query and analyze observability data. This architecture ensures rapid aggregation, efficient data handling, and a unified experience—all critical for modern monitoring and troubleshooting. SigNoz stands out as a strong choice for developers looking for fast and efficient insights from their telemetry data.
