No, Using SigNoz for observability comes with a straightforward pricing model as given below.

## Hidden Costs

SigNoz offers transparent pricing, and to help you maximize value, here are some key features that allow for cost optimisation:

- **Data Ingestion Limits**: Users can set limits on data ingestion using the [Ingestion Guard feature](https://signoz.io/blog/introducing-ingest-guard-feature/) to prevent surprise bills.
- **Retention Period Adjustments**: Longer retention periods for logs or metrics can incur additional costs if not managed properly, as the pricing is based on the volume of data retained.

## Comparison with Other Tools

SigNoz is often compared to Datadog, which has a more complex pricing structure that can lead to hidden costs due to its per-host and usage-based billing models. [Datadog's charges can escalate quickly with dynamic scaling and custom metrics](https://signoz.io/blog/datadog-pricing/), making it less predictable than [SigNoz's model](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/). 

In contrast, SigNoz's open-source version allows users to avoid recurring SaaS fees altogether, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious teams.

In summary, while SigNoz offers a relatively clear pricing structure with no hidden fees in its basic offerings, careful management of data ingestion and retention is essential to avoid unexpected costs.
