## Flask To-Do App with MongoDB

To demonstrate how to integrate OpenTelemetry in a Python application, we'll create a Flask-based to-do application with MongoDB. The application consists of a template-based frontend that handles user interactions and a backend that performs CRUD operations with MongoDB.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later.
- MongoDB is <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">installed</a> and running.

## Code Repo

The code samples for this tutorial series are present at this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SigNoz/opentelemetry-python-example). You can follow the series by cloning the repo and running the application from the respective lesson directories.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/opentelemetry-python-example.git
```

## Step 1: Clone the Github repository

First, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run the following commands to clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/opentelemetry-python-example.git
cd opentelemetry-python-example
```

## Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

There are several ways to work with virtual environments in Python. You can use `venv`, `virtualenv`, `pyenv` or `conda` to create and manage virtual environments. In this tutorial, we'll use `venv` to create a virtual environment. However, you can use any method you prefer.

Next, set up a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">virtual environment</a> to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Note: Depending on your Python installation, you may have to use `python3` or `python3.x` instead of `python`.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

This project uses Flask for serving the web application and PyMongo to interact with MongoDB. With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4: Ensure MongoDB Is Running

Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on the default port (27017). You can start it manually or use a process manager. To check if MongoDB is running, use:

```bash
pgrep mongod  # If a process ID is returned, MongoDB is running
```

If MongoDB is running, you should see a process ID. If not, start MongoDB with the following command:

```bash
mongod
```

## Step 5: Start the application

The application interacts with MongoDB to manage tasks. Start it with the following command:

```bash
python lesson-1/app.py
```

The application should be accessible at `localhost:5002`.

## Step 7: Test the Application

Now that application is running, you can interact with the application at `http://localhost:5002`. 

You can add, update, and delete tasks in the to-do list.

## Next Steps

In this tutorial, we've created a Flask-based to-do application with MongoDB database. The application service interacts with MongoDB to manage tasks.

In the next lesson, we will set up an account on SigNoz. OpenTelemetry does not provide a storage and an analytics layer. Once the data is collected with OpenTelemetry, you can send it to a backend that supports OpenTelemetry data format. We’ve built SigNoz to be OpenTelemetry-native from the ground up - let’s set it up.
