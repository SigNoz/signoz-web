In the previous tutorials, we have seen how to manually create spans in a Python application. In this tutorial, we will look at how to configure OTel logging SDK in a Python application.

The OpenTelemetry SDK provides a handler that can be used to transport logs to any OTLP-compatible backend. The following code snippets show how to configure the OTel logging SDK in a Python application.

## Code Repo

Hereâ€™s the code repo for this tutorial: [GitHub repo link](https://github.com/SigNoz/opentelemetry-python-example/tree/main/lesson-6)

## Configure the logging SDK

```python
import logging
from opentelemetry._logs import set_logger_provider
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc._log_exporter import (
    OTLPLogExporter,
)
from opentelemetry.sdk._logs import LoggerProvider, LoggingHandler
from opentelemetry.sdk._logs.export import BatchLogRecordProcessor

logger_provider = LoggerProvider()
set_logger_provider(logger_provider)

exporter = OTLPLogExporter()
logger_provider.add_log_record_processor(BatchLogRecordProcessor(exporter))
handler = LoggingHandler(level=logging.NOTSET, logger_provider=logger_provider)

# Attach OTLP handler to root logger
logging.getLogger().addHandler(handler)

```

In the above code snippet, a handler is created using the `LoggingHandler` class. The handler is attached to the root logger using the `addHandler()` method. The handler receives log records from the logger and sends them to the OTLP backend using the `OTLPLogExporter`.

## See your logs in SigNoz

Go to `Logs` tab of SigNoz and apply filter for your Flask application service. You will be able to see the logs coming from your application.

## Next Steps

In this tutorial, we configured the Python application to send logs to SigNoz using the OpenTelemetry logging SDK.

In the next tutorial, we will see how to customize the metrics stream produced by OpenTelemetry SDK using views.
