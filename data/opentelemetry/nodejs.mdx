OpenTelemetry is a set of tools, APIs, and SDKs used to instrument applications to create and manage telemetry data(Logs, metrics, and traces). For any distributed system based on microservice architecture, it's an operational challenge to solve performance issues quickly.

Telemetry data helps engineering teams to troubleshoot issues across services and identify the root causes. In other words, telemetry data powers observability for your distributed applications.

Steps to get started with OpenTelemetry for a Nodejs application:

- Creating a SigNoz cloud account
- Setting Up the OpenTelemetry Collector
- Creating a Sample Nodejs application
- Instrumenting the Application with OpenTelemetry
- Viewing the Telemetry Data in SigNoz

## Creating a SigNoz Cloud Account

To begin monitoring your applications with SigNoz, start by creating an account on the SigNoz platform. SigNoz cloud is the easiest way to run SigNoz. [**Sign up**](https://signoz.io/teams/) for a free account and get 30 days of unlimited access to all features.

You can also install and self-host SigNoz yourself since it is open-source. With 19,000+ GitHub stars, [**open-source SigNoz**](https://github.com/signoz/signoz) is loved by developers. Find the [**instructions**](https://signoz.io/docs/install/) to self-host SigNoz.

In this tutorial, we will be using SigNoz cloud. Once your account setup is complete, you’ll receive an email with a URL to access the SigNoz UI. Use this URL to log in and access your personalized dashboard.

## Creating a Sample Nodejs application

This section guides you through setting up a basic Node.js application, instrumenting it with OpenTelemetry, and sending telemetry data to SigNoz.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 12 or newer. Download the latest version of Node.js [**here**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Quick Start

To avoid manual setup, clone the [sample Node.js app repository](https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-nodejs-app), which is pre-configured with OpenTelemetry instrumentation. However, to fully understand the process, you are recommended to follow the steps below.

### Steps to Build the Application

For the sample application, let's create a basic 'hello world' express.js application.

1. **Verify Node installation**
    
    Check if Node.js is installed:
    
    ```jsx
    node -v
    ```
    
2. **Create a Project Directory and Install Dependencies**
    
    Create a directory for your app and install the required packages:
    
    ```jsx
    mkdir sample-node-app
    cd sample-node-app
    npm i express cors
    ```
    
    - **`express`**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js, used to create the HTTP server.
    - **`cors`**: A middleware to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues.
3. **Write Your Application Code**
    
    Create a file named **`index.js`** in your directory and add the following code:
    
    ```jsx
    const express = require("express");
    const cors = require('cors')
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || "5555";
    const app = express();
    
    app.use(cors());
    app.use(express.json())
    
    app.all("/", (req, res) => {
     res.json({ method: req.method, message: "Hello World", ...req.body });
     });
     
     app.get('/404', (req, res) => {
     res.sendStatus(404);
     })
     
     app.listen(parseInt(PORT, 10), () => {
     console.log(`Listening for requests on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
     })
    ```
    
    This creates a very simple “Hello World” application.
    
    **Code Breakdown:**
    
    - Creates a simple server using **`express`**.
    - Defines two routes:
        - **`/`**: Responds with a JSON payload.
        - **`/404`**: Responds with a 404 status code.
    - The server listens on port **`5555`** or an environment-specified port.
4. Run the Application
    
    Start the server with:
    
    ```jsx
    node index.js
    ```
    
    Visit [http://localhost:5555/](http://localhost:5555/) to confirm the app is running.

    <figcaption><i>Node application running</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    Once you have confirmed it works, exit the application by using **`Ctrl + C`** on your terminal.
    

## Set up OpenTelemetry and Send Data to SigNoz

SigNoz offers various [instrumentation methods](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-javascript/#send-traces-to-signoz-cloud) to help you send telemetry data from your application to SigNoz Cloud for comprehensive monitoring and analysis. In this tutorial, we will utilize the [No Code Automatic Instrumentation](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-javascript/#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud---no-code-automatic-instrumentation-recommended) method, which simplifies the process by collecting telemetry data without requiring code changes.

1. **Install OpenTelemetry Packages**
    
    To enable telemetry data collection for your application, you need to install the necessary OpenTelemetry packages. Use the following commands:
    
    ```jsx
    npm install --save @opentelemetry/api
    npm install --save @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
    ```
    
    These libraries enable automatic instrumentation and interaction with the OpenTelemetry API.
    
2. **Configure Environment Variables**

    <Admonition type="info">
    These environment variables are applicable for SigNoz cloud. You don't need Ingestion key if you're using self-hosted SigNoz. For self-hosted SigNoz, please refer to instructions [here](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-javascript/).
    </Admonition>
    
    To configure OpenTelemetry for your application, export the necessary environment variables. These variables define the data export settings and identify your application in SigNoz.
    
    Run the below in your terminal:
    
    ```jsx
    export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER="otlp"
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT="<SIGNOZ_ENDPOINT>"
    export OTEL_NODE_RESOURCE_DETECTORS="env,host,os"
    export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="<APP_NAME>"
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
    export NODE_OPTIONS="--require @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node/register"
    ```
    
    Here is a breakdown of the environment variables used:
    
    | **Variable** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | **`OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER`** | Specifies the traces exporter. Set to `"otlp"` to use the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting trace data. |
    | **`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`** | The SigNoz ingestion URL. You should have received this URL via email after registering with SigNoz Cloud. |
    | **`OTEL_NODE_RESOURCE_DETECTORS`** | Identifies additional resource metadata such as environment, host, and OS for better trace context. |
    | **`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`** | The name of your application. This will appear in SigNoz as the service being monitored. |
    | **`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`** | Contains authentication headers, including your SigNoz ingestion key. |
    | **`NODE_OPTIONS`** | Configures the Node.js runtime to preload OpenTelemetry's auto-instrumentation library. |
    
    Be sure to replace `<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>` with your actual SigNoz ingestion key. If you haven't created one yet, you can follow [this guide](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/) to generate your access key.

    <figcaption><i>Variables exported</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    
3. **Start the Application**
    
    After setting the environment variables, start your application by running:
    
    ```jsx
    node index.js
    ```
    
    You can check your application running at [**http://localhost:5555/**](http://localhost:5555/). 
    
    You need to generate some load in order to see data reported on SigNoz dashboard. Refresh the endpoint for 10-20 times, and wait for 2-3 mins.
    

## Monitoring your Application in SigNoz

Once your application is running and has generated some load, you can begin monitoring it in your SigNoz Cloud account. Navigate to the **`Services`** tab, you should see your application listed.

SigNoz makes it easy to visualize metrics and traces captured through OpenTelemetry instrumentation. It comes with out-of-box RED metrics charts and visualization. RED metrics stand for:

- Rate of requests
- Error rate of requests
- Duration taken by requests

Click on your application in the **`Services`** tab to be redirected to the **`Metrics`** page, where you can explore these metrics in detail.

<figcaption><i>Measure things like application latency, requests per sec, error percentage and see your top endpoints</i></figcaption>
</figure>

For more detailed analysis, navigate to the **`Traces`** tab. Here, you choose a particular timestamp where latency is high to drill down to traces around that timestamp to investigate the root cause.
Additionally, you can apply filters to narrow down the data, focusing on specific spans, error types, or request paths, which allows for a more targeted investigation of performance bottlenecks or issues in your application.

<figcaption><i>Trace tab in SigNoz</i></figcaption>
</figure>

SigNoz provides flamegraphs, which are an invaluable tool for visualizing the exact duration taken by each span in a trace. Flamegraphs allow you to pinpoint which parts of your application are contributing to high latency.
