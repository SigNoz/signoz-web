If you’re using a Windows server and want to know what happened to your machine, Windows logs are an essential resource. Windows logs record various system activities, errors, and other significant events, providing valuable information for troubleshooting, auditing, and ensuring system integrity. Understanding how to access, interpret, and utilise these logs enables efficient, problem solving, enables security measures and ensures the smooth operation of your system.

In this guide, you will learn about Windows event logs, its different categories, how to filter and create Custom Views.

## What is a Windows Event Log?

A Windows event log is a file that keeps track of system events and errors, application issues, and security events. Windows Event log can also provide insights into an application's behavior by tracking its interactions with other processes and services. With the right knowledge of the information stored in these logs, you can easily diagnose and easily resolve issues within your system and applications.

You can access the windows events logs as follows:

Using the Start Menu:

- Click on the Start button or press the Windows key.
- Type `Event Viewer` in the search box and select it from the search results.

Using the Run Dialog:

- Press `Windows + R` to open the Run dialog.

Using the Control Panel:

- Open the Command Prompt and run as administrator.
- Type `eventvwr` and press Enter.

You can see the detailed steps below. Now let’s discuss and understand windows events logs in detail.

## Understanding Windows Event Logs categories & Types

There are different Windows logs, each serving a specific purpose in tracking and recording events related to your system, applications, and security. They include:

- System Events: System events log information is about the core operations of your Windows operating system. System events are essential for maintaining your system's health and functionality because it records events related to the system's hardware and software components. Some system events are as follows:
  - Hardware Failures: Logs any issues related to hardware components, such as disc failures or memory errors.
  - Driver Issues: Records events related to the loading, unloading, or malfunctioning of device drivers. This helps in identifying driver-related problems that could affect system stability.
  - System Startups and Shutdowns: Tracks the times when the system starts up or shuts down. This can be useful for understanding system uptime and diagnosing issues related to improper shutdowns or startup failures.
- Application Events: Data related to software applications running on the system includes application errors, warnings, and informational messages. If you are using a Windows server to run your production-level application, you can use the application errors, warnings, and messages provided here to solve the issue. There are different types of Application events some are as follows:
  - Application Errors: Application errors are events generated by software applications when they encounter issues that prevent them from functioning correctly.
  - Warnings: Logs warnings from applications about potential issues that might not be critical but could lead to problems if not addressed.
  - Informational Messages: Provides general information about application activities, such as successful operations or status updates, helping to understand the normal functioning of applications.
- Security Events: Security events are logs that capture all security-related activities on your Windows system. They are essential for monitoring, maintaining, and auditing the security of your system. These events help detect unauthorised access attempts, monitor access to sensitive resources, and track changes to system policies. Some security events are as follows:
  - Successful and Failed Login Attempts: Successful and failed login attempts are critical events that are logged by a system to monitor access and ensure security. These logs provide valuable insights into user activity, helping to detect unauthorised access attempts and identify potential security threats.
  - Resource Access: These events log attempts to access protected resources such as files, folders, or system settings. Monitoring these logs ensures that sensitive data is accessed appropriately and helps identify unauthorised access attempts.
  - System Policy Changes: These logs record any changes to system policies, including modifications to user permissions or security settings. This is important for auditing purposes and ensuring compliance with security policies, helping to maintain the integrity and security of the system.
- Setup Events: Setup events are logs that contain detailed information about the installation and setup processes on your Windows system. These logs are valuable for diagnosing and resolving issues that occur during the installation or configuration of software and system components. Some Setup events are as follows:
  - Installation Processes: Installation processes refer to the series of steps and operations carried out to install software, updates, or system components on a Windows system. It contains log details about software installation, updates, or system components. This helps in diagnosing issues related to incomplete or failed installations.
  - Setup Configurations: Records information about system configurations during the setup process. This can be useful for understanding your system's initial setup and configuration.
- Forwarded Events: Forwarded events are logs sent from other computers to a centralised logging server. This is particularly useful in larger environments where centralised log management is needed. They include:
  - Logs from Remote Systems: Collects event logs from multiple systems, allowing for centralised monitoring and management.
  - Centralised Logging Scenarios: Useful for organisations that need to aggregate logs from various systems to a single location for easier analysis and monitoring.

## Accessing the Windows Event Viewer

Windows Event Viewer is a Windows application that lets you see your computer's logs, warnings, and other events. Each application you open generates entries that are recorded in an activity log, which can be viewed from the Event Viewer.

There are several ways to access the Windows Event Viewer. Here are some of them:

1. Using the Start Menu:

   - Click on the Start button or press the Windows key.
   - Type `Event Viewer` in the search box.

### Windows Log Location

Windows event logs are stored in files located in the `C:\\Windows\\System32\\winevt\\Logs` directory. Each log file corresponds to a specific log category, such as System, Application, or Security. It may differ depending on which version of Windows you are using.

The main event log files are:

1. Application.evtx: Logs events from applications and programs.
2. Security.evtx: Logs security events like successful or failed logins.
3. System.evtx: Logs events related to Windows system components and drivers

<Figure
  src="/img/guides/2024/07/windows-logs-Untitled%203.webp"
  alt="Windows Event Viewer logs"
  caption="Windows Event Viewer logs"
/>
<br></br>You can find many other log files which could be related to system operations & other
processes that are happening inside the Windows System. Windows 11uses the `.evtx` format rather
than using the classic `EVT` format.

## Understanding Event Viewer Entries

Event Viewer entries provide detailed information about each logged event. It is like a log book for your Windows system. They record important happenings within the system, including applications, systems, security, failed events, etc. Understanding these entries is key to effective log management.

The key components of an Event Viewer entry are:

1. Date and Time: When the event occurred.
2. Source: The application or system component that generated the event.
3. Event ID: A unique identifier for the event type.
4. Level: The severity of the event (Information, Warning, Error, Critical).
5. User: The user account under which the event occurred.
6. Computer: The name of the computer where the event was logged.
7. Description: Detailed information about the event.

Each event in the Event Viewer has a severity level, indicating the importance and type of the event:

- Information (Green Light): These events resemble a green traffic light, signifying smooth sailing. They indicate successful operations or occurrences within your system.
- Warning (Yellow Light): Treat these entries with caution, like a yellow traffic light. They signal potential issues that warrant attention but might not cause immediate problems.
- Error (Orange Light): Think of error entries as an orange traffic light; proceed with care. They denote significant problems that could affect system functionality. Imagine an error message indicating a driver failure.
- Critical (Red Light): Critical entries are akin to a red traffic light; stop and address the situation immediately. They represent severe errors that have caused a major failure. A critical event might report a complete system shutdown or a critical service crashing.

<br></br>

### Filtering and Custom Views

Event Viewer allows you to filter events using a variety of parameters, including date, event level, source, and more. Consider the following scenario: your system exhibits weird behaviour, but the Event Viewer is overflowing with hundreds, if not thousands, of entries. Filtering steps and generating custom views can significantly reduce the workload. You may also construct custom views to focus on specific kinds of events:

1. In the Event Viewer, you’ll see Administrative Events, to create special logs right-click on "Custom Views" and select "Create Custom View."

/>
<br></br>1. In the Custom View page, you can see `logged` drop down, choose a preferred time or it
gives you an option to create a custom time to set. 2. On the Event Level choose an appropriate
level for your custom view, You can choose among the 5 levels.{' '}

<Figure
  src="/img/guides/2024/07/windows-logs-Untitled%208.webp"
  alt="Selecting Event Levels"

  src="/img/guides/2024/07/windows-logs-Untitled%2010.webp"
  alt="Filtering using: By Source"
  caption="Filtering using: By Source"
/>
<br></br>Once everything is set up according to your needs, save all events in Custom View as{' '}

from the drop-down menu and choose an appropriate location to save the logs. Click on the Save button. (A log file with the extension `.evtx` will be saved on your device).
