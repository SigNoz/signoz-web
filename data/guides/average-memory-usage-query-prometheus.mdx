Monitoring memory usage is crucial for maintaining healthy systems and optimizing application performance. Prometheus, a popular open-source monitoring system, offers powerful tools for tracking and analyzing memory metrics. This guide will show you how to calculate average memory usage in Prometheus, helping you gain valuable insights into your system's performance.

## Understanding Memory Usage Metrics in Prometheus

Before diving into calculations, it's essential to understand the key memory metrics Prometheus collects. 

Memory usage refers to the amount of RAM (Random Access Memory) currently utilized by your system. It's a crucial indicator of system health; high memory usage can lead to performance degradation or even system crashes if left unmonitored.

Prometheus collects various system metrics related to memory usage. Key metrics include:

- `node_memory_MemTotal_bytes`: Total memory available on the system.
- `node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes`: Memory available for use by applications and the OS (includes free memory and cache).
- `node_memory_MemFree_bytes`: Completely unused memory.
- `node_memory_Buffers_bytes`: Memory used by kernel buffers
- `node_memory_Cached_bytes`: Memory used by the page cache and slabs

Note: Memory usage differs from memory availability. Usage refers to the amount of memory currently in use, while availability indicates the memory that can be allocated to processes without swapping. 

## Common Memory Usage Queries in Prometheus

To get started with memory usage analysis, here are some basic Prometheus queries:

1. Basic Query for Total Memory Usage
    
    To calculate the total memory used as a percentage of total memory:
    
    ```arduino
    (node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes) 
    ```
    
2. Query for Percentage of Memory Used
    
    To get the percentage of memory in use:
    
    ```arduino
    (node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes) / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes * 100
    ```
    
3. Query for Memory Usage Over Time
    
    The `rate()` function can be used with a memory-related metric that has a counter-like behavior. For example, if you're tracking memory usage via a process or container metric that increases over time, you can use:
    
    Example Query for Memory Usage Increase Over Time:
    
    ```arduino
    rate(container_memory_usage_bytes[5m])
    ```
    
    Note: The above works for containers and not Linux-based servers.

## Calculating Average Memory Usage with PromQL

Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) provides powerful functions for calculating average memory usage. The two main functions you'll use are `avg()` and `avg_over_time()`.

Here's a step-by-step guide to constructing an average memory usage query:

1. Calculate the used memory:
    
    ```
    node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes
    ```
    
2. Calculate the average over time:
    
    ```
    avg_over_time(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes[1h]) - avg_over_time(node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes[1h])
    ```
    
3. Calculate the average across multiple instances:
    
    ```
    avg(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes) by (instance)
    ```
    

This query calculates the average memory usage across all monitored nodes over the past hour. Adjust the time range `[1h]` as needed for your specific use case.

### Advanced Memory Usage Calculations

For more complex scenarios, you can use advanced PromQL features:

1. Calculate memory usage across multiple nodes:
    
    ```
    sum(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes) by (instance)
    ```
    
    `sum()` with `by (instance)` gives total memory usage per instance. If you want the average memory usage across instances, you could do:
    
    ```
    avg(sum(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes) by (instance))
    ```
    
2. Use label selectors to filter data:
    
    To filter memory usage by a specific label (e.g., job):
    
    ```
    avg(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes{job="webserver"} - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes{job="webserver"})
    ```
    

### Memory Usage on Different Operating Systems

Based on different operating systems, different metrics are used for monitoring memory usage:

### Linux-Based Systems

Prometheus provides robust support for Linux-based systems, allowing easy collection of memory metrics via exporters like `node_exporter`. Commonly used metrics include `node_memory_MemTotal_bytes`, `node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes`, and `node_memory_MemFree_bytes`, as previously discussed.

### Windows-Based Systems

The wmi_exporter (now known as windows_exporter) is commonly used to monitor memory usage on Windows systems. This exporter collects a variety of Windows performance metrics, including memory usage. Key metrics available for Windows include:

- `windows_memory_physical_total`: Total physical memory available on the system.
- `windows_memory_physical_available`: Memory currently available for use.
- `windows_memory_physical_in_use`: Memory currently in use.

Example Query for Windows Memory Usage

To calculate memory usage on a Windows system, you can use the following PromQL query:

```
(windows_memory_physical_total - windows_memory_physical_available) / windows_memory_physical_total
```

This query calculates the percentage of memory in use.

### Memory Usage in Containers

When working with containerized applications, memory usage can be monitored using cAdvisor or the Kubelet metrics. For example, if you are using Kubernetes, the following container metrics can be helpful:

- `container_memory_usage_bytes`: Total memory currently used by a container.
- `container_memory_working_set_bytes`: Memory in use, excluding cache.

Example Query for Container Memory Usage

To calculate the average memory usage of a specific container:

```
avg(container_memory_usage_bytes{container="your-container-name"})
```

To monitor memory usage across all containers in a Kubernetes cluster:

```
avg(container_memory_usage_bytes) by (container)
```

## Visualizing Average Memory Usage in Grafana

Grafana is a popular visualization tool that enables users to create dynamic and interactive dashboards for monitoring various metrics. With its support for diverse data sources, you can easily integrate Prometheus as a data source in Grafana to visualize your metrics data.

To effectively visualize average memory usage in Grafana, follow these steps:

## FAQs

### What's the difference between memory usage and memory availability in Prometheus?

Memory usage refers to the amount of memory currently in use by the system and applications. In contrast, Memory availability, represented by `node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes`, indicates the amount of memory that can be allocated to processes without causing the system to swap. Availability considers free memory, page cache, and reclaimable memory.

### How often should I calculate average memory usage for my systems?

The frequency of average memory usage calculations depends on your specific needs. For most systems, calculating averages every 5-15 minutes provides a good balance between granularity and performance. However, you may need more frequent calculations for systems with rapid changes or less frequent for stable, long-running services.

### Can Prometheus help predict future memory usage trends?

While Prometheus itself doesn't provide built-in prediction capabilities, you can use its time series data to perform trend analysis and forecasting. Tools like Grafana can visualize trends, and you can export Prometheus data to specialized forecasting tools for more advanced predictions.

### How do I set up alerts for critical memory usage levels in Prometheus?

To set up alerts for critical memory usage:

1. Define alert rules in Prometheus's configuration file or through Alertmanager.
2. Specify the PromQL query that defines the alert condition (e.g., memory usage > 90%).
3. Set the duration for which the condition must be true before alerting.
4. Configure notification routes in Alertmanager to send alerts via email, Slack, or other channels.

Remember to test your alerts thoroughly to ensure they trigger appropriately and don't cause alert fatigue. You can also make use of Grafana alerts.
