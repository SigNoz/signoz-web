## Methods of Embedding Grafana Dashboards

There are several ways to embed Grafana dashboards into a web application, each suited to different levels of complexity and security requirements.

### 1. Snapshot Method

Grafana allows users to create public snapshots of dashboards, which can then be shared via a simple URL. These snapshots are static and provide a snapshot of the dashboard at the time it was created.

- Advantages: Quick and easy method to share a dashboard.
- Disadvantages: The data in the snapshot is static, and the dashboard is publicly accessible.

Follow the given steps to embed the static version of your Grafana dashboard: 

1. Open the dashboard you want to share.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/embedding-a-website-in-a-grafana-dashboard-image%201.webp" alt="Open the dashboard" caption="Open the dashboard" />
    
2. Click on the share icon in the top navigation bar.

3. Select the "Snapshot" tab.
4. Click "Publish to [snapshot.raintank.io](http://snapshot.raintank.io/)" to create a public snapshot.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/embedding-a-website-in-a-grafana-dashboard-image%203.webp" alt="Create a public snapshot" caption="Create a public snapshot" />
    
    You will get the Snapshot URL.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/embedding-a-website-in-a-grafana-dashboard-image%204.webp" alt="Fetch the Snapshot URL" caption="Fetch the Snapshot URL" />
    
5. After creating a snapshot of your Grafana dashboard, you can easily embed it into any web application or website using an iframe. 
    
    ### Embedding using Iframe
    
    An `iframe` (short for "inline frame") allows you to display content from one webpage inside another, such as embedding your Grafana dashboard into a separate web page or application.
    
    Here’s how you can do it:
    
    1. Copy the Embed Code:
    Use the following code snippet, and replace `your-snapshot-id` with the actual snapshot ID from your Grafana instance:
        
        ```html
        <iframe src="https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/your-snapshot-id" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        ```
        
        In this example:
        
        - The `src` attribute contains the link to your Grafana snapshot.
        - The `width` and `height` attributes control the size of the embedded dashboard. You can modify these values based on how large or small you want the dashboard to appear.
        - `frameborder="0"` removes the border around the iframe for a cleaner look.
    2. Where to Paste It:
    You can paste this code directly into the HTML of any web page or application that supports HTML, such as a web app, content management system, or even a simple HTML file. When the page loads, the Grafana snapshot will display within the specified area.
        
        Example HTML File
        
        ```sql
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <title>Embedded Grafana Dashboard</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>My Grafana Dashboard</h1>
            <p>Here is a live snapshot of my Grafana dashboard:</p>
        
            <!-- Embed Grafana Snapshot -->
            <iframe src="https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/your-snapshot-id" 
                    width="800" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        
            <p>Dashboard embedded using an iframe.</p>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```
        
    3. Adjust the Settings:
        - Width and Height: You can adjust the width and height parameters to fit the size of your page or app. For example, `width="100%"` will make it span the full width of the page.
        - Scrolling: By default, if the embedded dashboard is too large, users may need to scroll within the iframe. If needed, you can enable or disable scrolling using the `scrolling="yes"` or `scrolling="no"` attributes.
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/embedding-a-website-in-a-grafana-dashboard-image%205.webp" alt="Embedded Grafana Dashboard" caption="Embedded Grafana Dashboard" />
        

### 2. Public Dashboards Feature

You can make Grafana dashboards publicly accessible and then embed them into your website. This method allows for full interactivity and live data updates but does not provide fine-grained control over access.

- Advantages: Full interactivity and live updates.
- Disadvantages: Requires making the dashboard public, which may not be suitable for all use cases.

Grafana's public dashboard feature allows you to share entire dashboards without authentication:

1. Navigate to the dashboard you want to make public.
2. Click the "Share" button and select "Public dashboard".
3. Toggle the "Public dashboard" switch to enable it.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/embedding-a-website-in-a-grafana-dashboard-image%206.webp" alt="Public Dashboards Feature" caption="Public Dashboards Feature" />
    
4. Copy the provided URL and iframe code to embed the dashboard.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/embedding-a-website-in-a-grafana-dashboard-image%207.webp" alt="Dashboard URL using Public Dashboards Feature" caption="Dashboard URL using Public Dashboards Feature" />
    
5. Once you have the dashboard URL you can use an `iframe` as described before to embed it in the web page.

### 3. Grafana API Embedding

For more advanced use cases, you can use the Grafana API to embed dashboards dynamically. This method gives you full control over how dashboards are displayed and how data is fetched, allowing for more customization.

- Advantages: Highly customizable and secure.
- Disadvantages: Requires more effort to implement and maintain.

Steps for Embedding Grafana Dashboards Using the API

1. Login to Grafana as an admin. 
2. Go to Administration → Users and access → Service accounts, and click on `Add service account` button.

    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/embedding-a-website-in-a-grafana-dashboard-image%2010.webp" alt="Add service account token" caption="Add service account token" />
    
    Generate a token, you can also set an expiration date if you want. The token will be used for access.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/embedding-a-website-in-a-grafana-dashboard-image%2011.webp" alt="Generate token for service account" caption="Generate token for service account" />
    
5. Fetch the Dashboard UUID: Once you are in the dashboard you want to embed check the URL to get the dashboard UUID.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/embedding-a-website-in-a-grafana-dashboard-image%2012.webp" alt="Fetch the Dashboard UUID" caption="Fetch the Dashboard UUID" />
    
6. Fetch Dashboard Data
    
    Use Grafana's API to retrieve the dashboard JSON using the dashboard link:
    
    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <Service_account_token>" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         https://your-grafana-instance/api/dashboards/uid/<UID>
    ```
    
    Replace `<UID>` with the dashboard's UID from the URL.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/embedding-a-website-in-a-grafana-dashboard-image%2013.webp" alt="Test the URL" caption="Test the URL" />
    
7. Embed in Your Web Application
    
    To dynamically fetch and render the Grafana dashboard in your web application, you can use JavaScript. Instead of simply embedding the iframe, you can programmatically retrieve the dashboard data from Grafana's API and render it within your application.
    
    Here’s how to fetch the dashboard data using JavaScript:
    
    ```jsx
    const dashboardUrl = 'https://your-grafana-instance/api/dashboards/uid/your-dashboard-uid';
    const serviceAccountToken = 'your-service-account-token';
    
    fetch(dashboardUrl, {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${serviceAccountToken}` }
    })
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => renderDashboard(data.dashboard.panels))
      .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching the dashboard:', error));
    ```
    
    Explanation: 
    
    - `dashboardUrl`: This is the API endpoint for fetching your Grafana dashboard. Replace `'your-dashboard-uid'` with the actual UID of your dashboard.
    - `serviceAccountToken`: Grafana requires an API token (usually from a service account) to access the dashboard data. Ensure you replace `'your-service-account-token'` with a valid API token.
    - `renderDashboard(data.dashboard.panels)`: This function would contain logic to render the dashboard data (e.g., charts, graphs, panels) into your web application.
    
    Example of rendering function (a basic idea to start):
    
    ```jsx
    function renderDashboard(panels) {
      const dashboardContainer = document.getElementById('dashboard');
      panels.forEach(panel => {
        const panelElement = document.createElement('div');
        panelElement.className = 'panel';
        panelElement.innerHTML = `
          <h2>${panel.title}</h2>
          <img src="${panel.url}" alt="${panel.title}" />
        `;
        dashboardContainer.appendChild(panelElement);
      });
    }
    ```
    
    In this example:
    
    - Each panel's title and image (or content) are dynamically rendered within the HTML element with the ID `dashboard`.
    - You can modify `renderDashboard` based on your requirements, whether to display charts, panels, or other components.
8. Handle CORS: Enable embedding by setting `allow_embedding = true` in Grafana's `grafana.ini` under `[security]`.

## Security Considerations for Embedding

When embedding Grafana dashboards, security is a crucial factor, especially when dealing with sensitive or private data. Grafana provides several security measures that you should consider when embedding dashboards into web applications.

1. Enable Embedding

Ensure that embedding is allowed by setting the following configuration in your Grafana instance:

```
[security]
allow_embedding = true
```

Setting `allow_embedding = true` in the Grafana configuration is crucial for enabling the embedding of dashboards in external websites or applications. Without this setting, Grafana blocks embedding due to security restrictions, preventing iframe usage.

2. Protect Private Dashboards

Embedding private dashboards requires authentication. You can handle authentication by using tokens or session-based authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the embedded content.

Limitations of embedding private dashboards with authentication:

- Embedding private dashboards with authentication can be challenging because users may need valid credentials to access the content, complicating the seamless experience.
- Additionally, managing access tokens or API keys securely across different platforms can expose sensitive information and increase the risk of unauthorized access.

3. Secure API Access

If you’re using the Grafana API for embedding, ensure your API access is properly secured, ideally using token-based authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).

### Best Practices for Securing Embedded Dashboards

- Implement HTTPS to secure data in transit.
- Use OAuth or JWT tokens for secure authentication.
- Ensure proper access control to avoid exposing sensitive data.

## Troubleshooting Common Embedding Issues

When embedding Grafana dashboards, you might encounter some challenges:

1. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Issues:
    - Enable CORS in your Grafana configuration:
        
        ```
        allow_embedding = true
        cookie_samesite = none
        ```
        
    - Set appropriate CORS headers on your web server
2. Authentication Challenges:
    - Use API tokens for server-side requests to Grafana
    - Implement OAuth or SAML for seamless user authentication
3. Performance Optimization:
    - Limit the number of panels in embedded dashboards
    - Use efficient queries and appropriate time ranges
    - Consider using Grafana's caching features
4. Responsive Design:
    - Make sure that your embedded dashboard is responsive to various screen sizes by adjusting the iframe size or using CSS media queries.
        
        ```html
        <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;">
          <iframe src="..." style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe>
        </div>
        ```
