Regex, short for "regular expressions," is a powerful tool for searching and manipulating text patterns. When combined with Grafana, a popular open-source visualization tool, regex allows users to filter, refine, and visualize data more effectively. This guide will walk you through the process of using regex in Grafana queries, from the basics to advanced techniques, to help you get the most out of your dashboards.

## Understanding Regex in Grafana Queries

Regex allows you to define complex text patterns that can match specific data points across large datasets. In Grafana, regex is crucial in filtering logs, selecting time series based on specific labels, and even creating dynamic dashboards. Understanding how to harness the power of regex can take your Grafana dashboards to the next level. 

Imagine you're monitoring an application with thousands of log entries. Instead of manually sifting through them, regex can help you isolate errors, warnings, or specific events with just a few characters. Or, if you're tracking metrics like CPU usage across multiple servers, regex can quickly filter out irrelevant data, leaving you with just the pertinent information to display on your dashboard.

In short, regex in Grafana makes your data more manageable, allowing you to create dynamic, focused dashboards that give you the insights you need without the noise.

Common use cases for regex in Grafana include:

- Filtering log streams to show only relevant entries.
- Matching specific time series or metric names that follow a particular pattern.
- Extracting segments of text from labels or field names for more precise data analysis.

### Key Regex Operators in Grafana

To harness the full power of regex in Grafana queries, familiarize yourself with these essential operators:

1. Wildcards (`.` and `*`): Used to match any character or multiple characters.``
    - Dot (`.`): Matches any single character except for newline characters. It’s useful for creating patterns where you need to match varying characters in specific positions.
        
        Example: `a.b` matches "a1b", "aXb", etc.
        
    - Asterisk (`*`): Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element. It allows for flexible matching of repeated characters or patterns.
        
        Example: `a*` matches "", "a", "aa", etc.
        
2. Character Classes and Negations (`[abc]` and `[^abc]`): Define a set of characters to match or exclude.
    - Character Classes (`[abc]`): Matches any single character within the brackets. This is useful for specifying a set of acceptable characters at a given position.
        
        Example: `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter.
        
    - Negated Character Classes (`[^abc]`): Matches any single character not in the brackets. This is useful for excluding certain characters from matches.
        
        Example: `[^0-9]` matches any non-digit character.
        
3. Quantifiers (`?`, `+`, `{n}`):  Specify how many times a character or group should appear.
    - Question Mark (`?`): Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding element. It makes the preceding character or group optional.
        
        Example: `a?` matches "" or "a".
        
    - Plus (`+`): Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element. It ensures that at least one instance of the preceding character or group is present.
        
        Example: `a+` matches "a", "aa", etc.
        
    - Curly Braces (`{n}`): Matches exactly `n` occurrences of the preceding element. This is useful for specifying precise repetition counts.
        
        Example: `a{2}` matches "aa".
        
4. Anchors and Boundaries (`^` and `$`): Set positions in a string.
    - Caret (`^`): Matches the start of a string. It ensures that the pattern is found at the beginning of the string.
        
        Example: `^start` matches "start of the line" but not "the start".
        
    - Dollar Sign (`$`): Matches the end of a string. It ensures that the pattern is found at the end of the string.
        
        Example: `end$` matches "the end" but not "end of the line".
        

Here’s a summary highlighting the Key Regex Operators

## Setting Up Your Grafana Environment for Regex Queries

Before diving into regex queries, ensure your Grafana environment is properly configured:

1. Configure compatible data sources: Grafana supports several data sources that utilize regex for querying. Ensure you select data sources that support regex operations, such as Prometheus, Loki, InfluxDB, and Elasticsearch.
2. Enable regex options: In Grafana's settings, ensure regex support is enabled for your data sources.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Writing Regex Queries in Grafana

Regex queries in Grafana can transform how you filter, display, and analyze data. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you write and implement regex queries effectively:

1. Access the Query Editor
    - Start by opening your Grafana dashboard and selecting the panel where you want to write a query.
    - Click on the panel title, and select Edit to open the query editor.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/a-regex-in-query-in-grafana-image%202.webp" alt="Query Editor in Grafana Panel" caption="Query Editor in Grafana Panel" />
    
2. Write a Basic Regex Query for Log Filtering
    
    Start with a Basic Log Query
    
    ```jsx
    {job="varlogs"}
    ```
    
    This selects all logs from the `varlogs` job.
    
    Note: For log filtering, you need to configure Loki and Promtail. Read the details <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/a-regex-in-query-in-grafana-image%203.webp" alt="Basic Regex Query for Log Filtering" caption="Basic Regex Query for Log Filtering" />
    
3. Implementing Regex in Prometheus Metric Queries
Regex can be a powerful tool in Prometheus queries, especially when you want to filter metrics based on their names or labels. Here’s how you can do it:
    
    Let’s say you want to filter all metrics related to HTTP requests in your Flask application:
    
    ```jsx
    {__name__=~"http_requests.*"}
    ```
    
    - `name` is a built-in label that stores the metric name.
    - `=~` is the regex match operator.
    - `http_requests.*` matches any metric name that starts with http_requests.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/a-regex-in-query-in-grafana-image%204.webp" alt="Implementing Regex in Prometheus Metric Queries" caption="Implementing Regex in Prometheus Metric Queries" />
    
    You can also filter metrics by their labels using regex.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    http_requests_total{instance=~"localhost:[port_number]"}
    ```
    
    This query filters `http_requests_total` metrics for instances with names like `localhost:8080`, [`localhost:8081`](http://localhost:8081), etc.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/a-regex-in-query-in-grafana-image%205.webp" alt="Filter metrics by their labels using regex in Grafana" caption="Filter metrics by their labels using regex in Grafana" />
    

4.  Leverage Grafana's Variable System

- Grafana’s variable system allows you to make your dashboards dynamic. For instance, you could create a variable `service` to filter data by service names:
    
    ```
    {service=~"$service"}
    ```
    
- The `$service` variable would populate dynamically based on user input or predefined options, making your dashboard adaptable to different contexts.
    
    How do you add variables to the Grafana Dashboard? 
    
    1. Navigate to the dashboard where you want to add a variable. Click the gear icon (⚙️) and select "Variables". Then click "Add variable".
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/a-regex-in-query-in-grafana-image%206.webp" alt="Adding Variable in Grafana Dashboard" caption="Adding Variable in Grafana Dashboard" />
        
    2. Configure Variable:
        1. Name: Assign a name to your variable, such as `instance`.
        2. Type: Choose "Query".
        3. Data Source: Select your data source.
            
            <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/a-regex-in-query-in-grafana-image%207.webp" alt="Creating a Variable in Grafana Dashboard" caption="Creating a Variable in Grafana Dashboard" /> 
            
        4. Query: Define a query to fetch values, for example, to list all instances. 
            
            <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/a-regex-in-query-in-grafana-image%208.webp" alt="Define Query for fetching values for dynamic variable" caption="Define Query for fetching values for dynamic variable" />
            
            Note: There are multiple ways to configure how you want to populate the value for the created variable.
            
            - In the image above, the Query type is `label values` , which means the value to be populated is label value.
            - Next for what label? As defined `Label` = `instance`
            - Now, it knows the variable needs to be populated for label values for label key = `instance`
            - Where to look for this label?  In the metric `https_requests_created`
        5. Options: Set refresh intervals, allow multiple values, or include an "All" option if needed.
        6. Click the `Run Query` button, to get a preview of values based on the query you have provided.
            
            <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/a-regex-in-query-in-grafana-image%209.webp" alt="Previewing values for dynamic variables in Grafana" caption="Previewing values for dynamic variables in Grafana" />
            
        
        Click "Apply" to save your variable, and the `Save Dashboard` to apply the changes to your dashboard.
        
    3. Use the Variable in Queries
        - Edit a Panel: Open the panel where you want to use the variable.
            - Apply the Variable: In the query editor, include the variable in your Prometheus query. For example:
            
            ```
            http_requests_total{instance=~"$instance"}
            ```
            
            - `$instance` is the variable you created. It will dynamically reflect the selected value(s) from the dropdown.
            
            <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/a-regex-in-query-in-grafana-image%2010.webp" alt="Running Regex query using Dynamic variable in Grafana" caption="Running Regex query using Dynamic variable in Grafana" />
            
        - Save Changes: Click "Apply" and save the panel.

### Advanced Regex Techniques for Grafana

To take your Grafana queries to the next level, consider these advanced regex techniques:

<aside>
💡

Note: 
Prometheus does support regex-based filtering, but advanced regex techniques such as lookaheads, lookbehinds, and non-capturing groups are not supported in Prometheus queries. These work on log filtering with LOKI as the data source.

</aside>

- Lookahead and Lookbehind: Use lookaheads and lookbehinds to filter based on context without including certain characters in the match.
    - Example: Match instances of "error" followed by digits except "0":
        
        ```
        error(?!0)\d
        ```
        
- Capturing Groups: Capture parts of your pattern to reuse in more complex queries.
    - Example: Capture "app" or "service" followed by any word:
        
        ```
        (app|service)\w+
        ```
        
- Non-Capturing Groups: Use non-capturing groups `(?:...)` to group elements without saving them, improving performance.
    - Example: Match either "cpu" or "mem" but don’t capture:
        
        ```
        (?:cpu|mem)_usage
        ```
        
- Regex Alternation: Use `|` to match alternative patterns.
    - Example: Match logs with either "timeout" or "error":
        
        ```
        timeout|error
        ```
        

## Optimizing Regex Performance in Grafana Queries

Efficient regex patterns are crucial for maintaining dashboard performance. 

<aside>
💡

Note: Prometheus uses a simplified regex engine with limited features for better performance. Keep these limitations in mind while optimizing your queries.

</aside>

Consider these optimization techniques:

- Keep Regex Simple: Simplify patterns to reduce the load on Prometheus. Avoid unnecessary wildcards like `.*` that match everything and can degrade performance.
    - Example: Instead of `.*error.*`, use `error`.
- Use Anchors for Precision: Use `^` (start) and `$` (end) to define the beginning and end of a match. This makes the query more efficient by narrowing the search scope.
    - Example: `^node_cpu_.*_total$` matches only metrics with this exact structure.
- Avoid Greedy Quantifiers: Use non-greedy quantifiers like `.*?` to minimize backtracking when matching long patterns.
    - Example: `error.*?log` matches "error" followed by "log" with minimal backtracking.
- Leverage Non-Capturing Groups: Use non-capturing groups `(?:...)` to group parts of your regex without storing the match, which can save processing time.
    - Example: `(?:cpu|mem)_usage` instead of `(cpu|mem)_usage`.
- Pre-filter with Labels: Where possible, use PromQL label filtering before applying regex, narrowing down the dataset to reduce the regex workload.
    - Example: `http_requests_total{job="nginx", path=~"^/api.*"}`
- Limit Use of Alternations: Minimize the use of `|` (alternation) as it can create multiple branches to evaluate. Instead, try combining alternatives more efficiently or use explicit patterns.
    - Example: Replace `foo|bar|baz` with something like `ba[rz]|foo` if patterns overlap.

### Best Practices for Organizing Dashboards with Regex-Based Queries

1. Use Meaningful Variables: Define clear and intuitive variables (e.g., `$instance`, `$service`) to make filtering dynamic and user-friendly. Use regex for flexibility when querying multiple values.
2. Optimize Regex Patterns: Keep regex patterns simple and efficient. Avoid overly complex expressions to reduce query load, e.g., use `service=~"web.*"` instead of `service=~".*web.*"`.
3. Leverage Multi-Value Variables: Enable multi-value selections in variables to allow filtering for multiple services or instances using regex like `instance=~"$instance"`.
4. Group Panels by Functionality: Organize panels logically, grouping them by services or resources, with regex filtering applied across multiple panels to maintain consistency.

## Integrating Regex Queries with Grafana Alerting

Regex queries in Grafana can be combined with alerting to dynamically trigger alerts based on complex patterns in your metrics or logs. 

1. Create alert rules with regex conditions:
    
    ```
    avg(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) > 10
    ```
    
    This alert triggers when the average rate of 5xx errors exceeds 10 per second over 5 minutes.
    
2. Design regex patterns for anomaly detection:
    
    ```
    {job="app"} |~ "(?i)exception|error|fail" | rate[5m] > 0.1
    ```
    
    This pattern alerts on an increased rate of exceptions, errors, or failures (case-insensitive).
    
3. Implement regex in notification templates:
    
    ```
    {{ if reReplaceAll "^CRITICAL: (.+)" .Message "$1" }}
    High Priority: {{ .Message }}
    {{ else }}
    Low Priority: {{ .Message }}
    {{ end }}
    ```
    
    This template prioritizes alerts based on the presence of "CRITICAL" in the message.
    

### How to Setup Alerts using Regex Queries in Grafana

1. In the Grafana Dashboard, go to the `Alerting` section, and click on `Manage Alert rules`. Next, click on the `+New alert rule` button.
2. Define the alert rule name, query, and alert conditions. For example, if the rate of errors is greater than 5 in a 5-minute window:
    
    ```java
    rate(http_error_total{error_type=~"^(value|type|another)_error"}[5m])
    ```
