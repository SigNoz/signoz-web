Apache Kafka is a cornerstone of modern data streaming architectures, acting as the backbone for real-time analytics, event-driven systems, and data pipelines. But even the most robust systems require diligent monitoring to perform at their best, and Kafka is no exception. To ensure smooth operations, Kafka metrics are like the health check for your Kafka cluster. They keep track of how everything is running, spotting any issues early so you can fix them before they become bigger problems. 

This guide explores Kafka metrics in detail, their importance, and how they can be leveraged to maintain optimal cluster management. Think of Kafka metrics as the dashboard indicators in a car—they keep you informed about engine health, fuel levels, and performance, allowing you to act before a problem stalls the journey.

## What Are Kafka Metrics and Why Are They Important?

Kafka metrics are quantitative indicators that offer a real-time view of how your Kafka cluster is functioning. Just as a fitness tracker monitors your heart rate, step count, and activity levels to provide insights into your health, Kafka metrics monitor the critical aspects of your cluster.

### Why Do Kafka Metrics Matter?

1. Monitoring Cluster Health
    
    Imagine running a manufacturing plant—machines must be checked regularly to avoid sudden breakdowns. Kafka metrics allow you to monitor your cluster's "machines" (brokers, producers, consumers) to detect and resolve issues before they disrupt operations.
    
2. Optimizing Performance
    
    Performance tuning is like fine-tuning a musical instrument; every adjustment affects the harmony. Kafka metrics help identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies, allowing you to optimize configurations for smoother performance and better throughput.
    
3. Capacity Planning
    
    Think of Kafka metrics as the load gauge on a bridge. They help you understand current usage and predict when additional capacity will be needed to handle increased loads. This proactive approach ensures your cluster can scale seamlessly as demands grow.
    
4. Efficient Troubleshooting
    
    When issues arise, metrics act as the breadcrumbs leading to the root cause. Just as a mechanic uses diagnostic codes to identify car issues, Kafka metrics pinpoint where a problem lies, reducing downtime and simplifying fixes.
    

Kafka metrics fall into four main categories:

- Brokers are like conveyor belts, responsible for moving data efficiently between components.
- Producers are the supply chain, ensuring a steady flow of raw materials (data) into the system.
- Consumers are the workers, processing the data to create meaningful outputs.
- ZooKeeper acts as the foreman, keeping everything synchronized and running smoothly.

## Essential Kafka Broker Metrics to Monitor

### 1. Broker Count

This metric represents the total number of active brokers in the Kafka cluster.

### Why Monitor This Metric?

1. Cluster Stability:
    - A drop in the broker count indicates that one or more brokers have become unresponsive or gone offline.
    - It is crucial to maintain the expected broker count to ensure data availability and fault tolerance.
2. Replication and Partition Distribution:
    - A decrease in brokers impacts partition replication and may lead to an increase in under-replicated partitions.
    - Uneven partition distribution can arise when brokers go offline, affecting performance.
3. Detect Failures Early:
    - Monitoring this metric helps detect and address broker crashes or connectivity failures.

### Recommended Actions:

- If the broker count drops unexpectedly, check the Kafka logs for errors related to the broker or network connectivity issues.
- Ensure proper monitoring of CPU, memory, and disk usage on the affected broker.
- Use tools like ZooKeeper or Kafka's metadata commands to verify the cluster state.

### 2. Request Times

This metric measures the time taken to handle requests in the Kafka cluster.

### Why Monitor This Metric?

1. Identify Latency Issues:
    - High request times indicate delays in processing producer, consumer, or admin requests, which could lead to bottlenecks.
2. Detect Resource Constraints:
    - Spikes in request times might suggest insufficient broker resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
3. Monitor Cluster Performance:
    - Persistent high request times may result in delayed message delivery, affecting downstream systems.

### No Data Scenario:

- If no data is shown for request times, it may mean that either:
    - No significant requests were made during the monitoring period.
    - The monitoring system might not be capturing this metric due to misconfiguration.

### Recommended Actions:

- Verify that metrics collection is correctly configured in your Kafka monitoring tool.
- Simulate producer or consumer traffic to observe the impact on request times.
- If request times are high, review broker logs, analyze network latency, and optimize disk I/O.

### 3. BytesInPerSec and BytesOutPerSec

These metrics represent the rate of incoming and outgoing network traffic in bytes per second for each broker.

### Why Are These Metrics Important?

1. Cluster Throughput Assessment:
    - BytesInPerSec reflects the amount of data being produced to the cluster.
    - BytesOutPerSec indicates the data consumed from the cluster.
    - Together, they provide a measure of the cluster's throughput, helping you evaluate whether the brokers can handle the current workload.
2. Identify Network Bottlenecks:
    - Sudden spikes in traffic can overwhelm network interfaces, leading to message delivery delays or dropped messages.
    - A persistent high value may suggest the need to optimize the network setup or upgrade bandwidth.
3. Capacity Planning:
    - Monitoring these metrics over time enables proactive planning for network upgrades to accommodate future traffic growth.

### Recommended Actions:

- Monitor Trends: Use these metrics to establish traffic baselines and detect anomalies such as sudden traffic surges.
- Optimize Configuration: Check broker network settings, including `socket.send.buffer.bytes` and `socket.receive.buffer.bytes`.
- Upgrade Infrastructure: If these metrics consistently approach network limits, consider scaling out your brokers or upgrading network capacity.

### 4. MessagesInPerSec

This metric tracks the number of messages produced to the cluster per second.

### Why Is This Metric Important?

1. Understand Processing Capacity:
    - Monitoring MessagesInPerSec helps gauge your cluster's ability to handle the current load of incoming messages.
    - A consistently high rate could indicate the need to scale up resources.
2. Identify Traffic Anomalies:
    - A sudden spike might indicate a new producer sending excessive messages, while a drop could signal producer issues or reduced application activity.
3. Correlate with Other Metrics:
    - When analyzed alongside BytesInPerSec, it provides insights into the size of incoming messages.
    - A high MessagesInPerSec with low BytesInPerSec might mean smaller message payloads, while the reverse indicates larger payloads.

### Recommended Actions:

- Scale Resources: If the metric approaches cluster capacity, consider increasing partition counts or adding brokers.
- Investigate Anomalies: For unexpected spikes, examine producer logs and traffic patterns.
- Optimize Producers: Tune producer configurations like batch size and compression type to handle higher message rates efficiently.

## Key Performance Indicators for Kafka Brokers

Monitoring Kafka brokers involves more than just basic metrics. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) provide in-depth insights into the cluster's health, stability, and performance. Below is a detailed explanation of critical Kafka broker KPIs:

### 1. ActiveControllerCount

### What It Measures:

This metric indicates the number of active controllers in the Kafka cluster. Kafka relies on a single controller to manage administrative tasks, such as partition reassignments and broker state management.

### Healthy Value:

- The ActiveControllerCount should always be 1 in a healthy cluster.

### Why It Matters:

1. Cluster Coordination:
    - The controller manages the cluster's metadata and ensures synchronization between brokers.
    - Multiple active controllers can lead to split-brain scenarios, where conflicting states arise between brokers.
2. Cluster Availability:
    - If no active controller exists, Kafka cannot handle partition leadership changes or other administrative tasks, which can cause outages.
3. High Availability:
    - An active controller ensures that leader elections and partition assignments are performed efficiently during broker failures.

### Recommended Actions:

- If ActiveControllerCount is not 1, check:
    - The health of ZooKeeper (or KRaft, if used) as it manages controller elections.
    - Broker logs for errors indicating controller election failures.
- Configure proper timeouts for controller elections in Kafka settings (`zookeeper.session.timeout.ms`).

### 2. OfflinePartitionsCount

### What It Measures:

This metric tracks the number of partitions that are unavailable for reads or writes because no in-sync replicas are available.

### Healthy Value:

- The OfflinePartitionsCount should ideally be 0.

### Why It Matters:

1. Data Availability:
    - Offline partitions cannot process messages, causing disruptions for producers and consumers.
2. Risk of Data Loss:
    - Persistent offline partitions can lead to message loss if the cluster cannot replicate the missing data.
3. Cluster Imbalance:
    - Offline partitions often indicate broker failures or issues with partition replication.

### Recommended Actions:

- Investigate the cause of offline partitions:
    - Check broker logs for errors related to storage, memory, or network failures.
    - Ensure that brokers hosting the partitions are online and reachable.
- Review replication factors and ensure that critical topics have sufficient redundancy.
- Set up alerts for non-zero OfflinePartitionsCount to address issues promptly.

### 3. LeaderElectionRate

### What It Measures:

This metric shows the frequency of leadership changes for partitions in the Kafka cluster.

### Healthy Range:

- LeaderElectionRate should remain relatively low under normal operation. High values are a red flag.

### Why It Matters:

1. Cluster Stability:
    - Frequent leader elections indicate instability caused by broker failures, high network latency, or misconfigurations.
2. Performance Impact:
    - Leadership changes disrupt partition processing temporarily, increasing producer and consumer latencies.
3. Configuration Issues:
    - Misconfigured timeout settings can lead to premature leader elections, even when brokers are healthy.

### Recommended Actions:

- Identify and resolve causes of frequent leader elections:
    - Check broker logs for errors indicating failures or network connectivity issues.
    - Review timeout settings (`session.timeout.ms` and `heartbeat.interval.ms`) to prevent unnecessary leader changes.
- Scale the cluster if frequent elections occur due to resource contention.

### 4. UncleanLeaderElectionsPerSec

### What It Measures:

This metric tracks the rate of unclean leader elections in the cluster. An unclean leader election occurs when a partition's leader fails, and none of the in-sync replicas (ISRs) are available to take over. Kafka elects an out-of-sync replica, which risks data loss.

### Healthy Value:

- UncleanLeaderElectionsPerSec should always be 0.

### Why It Matters:

1. Data Consistency:
    - An unclean leader election can result in data loss because the new leader may not have the latest data.
2. Cluster Reliability:
    - Frequent unclean elections indicate serious issues with replication, such as insufficient ISRs or slow replica recovery.
3. Replication Settings:
    - Misconfigured replication settings (e.g., low replication factors or incorrect `min.insync.replicas`) increase the risk of unclean elections.

### Recommended Actions:

- Prevent unclean elections:
    - Set `unclean.leader.election.enable=false` to disable unclean elections entirely.
    - Increase replication factors for critical topics to ensure more ISRs are available.
    - Ensure brokers have sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to handle replication efficiently.
- Monitor replication lag and troubleshoot brokers with slow replicas.

## Critical Kafka Producer Metrics for Optimal Performance

Producer metrics help you understand how efficiently your applications are sending data to Kafka. Key metrics include:

### RecordSendRate

This metric measures the rate at which the producer sends records to Kafka brokers. It helps you:

- Gauge producer throughput
- Identify performance bottlenecks in the producing application

### RecordErrorRate

This metric tracks the rate of failed record sends. A high error rate may indicate:

- Network issues
- Broker unavailability
- Misconfigured producer settings

### BatchSizeAvg

The average batch size affects both latency and throughput. Monitoring this metric allows you to:

- Optimize producer performance
- Balance between latency and throughput requirements

### RequestLatency

This metric measures the time taken for a produce request to be acknowledged by the broker. High latency can impact:

- Overall system performance
- End-to-end data processing times

## Essential Kafka Consumer Metrics to Track

Consumer metrics are crucial for understanding how efficiently your applications are processing data from Kafka. Key metrics include:

### RecordsConsumedRate

This metric measures the rate at which the consumer is processing records. It helps you:

- Assess consumer throughput
- Identify potential processing bottlenecks

### FetchRate

The fetch rate indicates how often the consumer is requesting data from Kafka. Monitoring this metric helps you:

- Understand consumer behaviour
- Optimize consumer configurations for better performance

### MaxLag and MaxLagConsumer

These metrics show the maximum lag (in terms of messages) for any partition in a consumer group. High lag values may indicate:

- Consumer processing issues
- Need for consumer group scaling
- Potential data freshness problems in downstream applications

### RecordsLagMax

This metric represents the maximum lag in terms of the number of records for any partition in a consumer group. It's crucial for:

- Detecting potential data processing delays
- Ensuring timely data consumption in real-time applications

## Understanding and Monitoring ZooKeeper Metrics

While Kafka is moving towards removing the ZooKeeper dependency, many clusters still rely on it. Key ZooKeeper metrics include:

### ZkRequestLatency

This metric measures the time taken for ZooKeeper to respond to requests. High latency can impact:

- Kafka's overall performance
- Cluster management operations

### OutstandingRequests

This metric shows the number of requests waiting to be processed by ZooKeeper. A high value may indicate:

- ZooKeeper overload
- Potential performance issues in Kafka operations

### WatchCount

This metric tracks the number of watches placed on ZooKeeper znodes. It helps you:

- Understand client connection patterns
- Identify potential memory pressure on ZooKeeper

### NodeCount

This metric shows the total number of znodes in your ZooKeeper ensemble. Monitoring it helps you:

- Track ZooKeeper's data growth
- Plan for potential ZooKeeper scaling needs

## How to Collect and Visualize Kafka Metrics

Effective monitoring requires proper collection and visualization of Kafka metrics. Here's how you can set it up:

1. Use JMX for Kafka Metrics
    
    Kafka exposes metrics via JMX (Java Management Extensions) by default. Ensure your Kafka brokers are configured to enable remote JMX connections.
    
2. Collect Metrics with SigNoz
    
    SigNoz provides built-in support for collecting Kafka metrics seamlessly. Set up SigNoz to ingest these metrics through its OpenTelemetry-based architecture.
    
3. Visualize Metrics in SigNoz
    
    Leverage SigNoz's intuitive dashboards to monitor Kafka metrics in real-time. These dashboards are customizable, allowing you to focus on the metrics most critical to your operations.
    
4. Configure Alerts in SigNoz
    
    Set up intelligent alerts in SigNoz to notify your team when key Kafka metrics exceed predefined thresholds. This ensures proactive identification and resolution of potential issues.

- Clone [this](https://github.com/SigNoz/kafka-opentelemetry-instrumentation) repo as here there is a Java producer and consumer.

### Step 1: Kafka Setup

To monitor Kafka, ensure your Kafka instance is up and running with proper configurations.

### Kafka Installation:

1. Download Kafka:
    
    Obtain the latest <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/downloads" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Kafka release</a> and extract it:
    
    ```bash
    tar -xzf kafka-3.9.0-src.tgz
    cd kafka-3.9.0-src
    ```
    
2. Start ZooKeeper (if not using KRaft):
    
    Kafka requires ZooKeeper for managing brokers:
    
    ```bash
    bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
    
    ```
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/12/kafka-metrics-Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_8.12.25_AM.webp" alt="" caption="" />3. Configure and Start Two Kafka Brokers:
- Copy the default server configuration file and customize it:
    
    ```bash
    cp config/server.properties config/s1.properties
    
    ```
    
- Edit `s1.properties` to set the following:
    
    ```
    broker.id=0
    listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
    logs.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs-1
    zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181
    ```
    
- Repeat for the second broker (`s2.properties`) with:
    
    ```
    broker.id=1
    listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9093
    logs.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs-2
    zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181
    
    ```
    
- Start both brokers in separate terminals:
    
    ```bash
    JMX_PORT=2020 bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/s1.properties
    JMX_PORT=2021 bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/s2.properties
    
    ```
    
1.  Create Kafka Topics:
    
    ```bash
    bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic topic1 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 2 --partitions 2
    bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic topic2 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 2 --partitions 1
    
    ```
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/12/kafka-metrics-Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_3.41.20_PM.webp" alt="" caption="" />Verify the setup:

    bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic topic1 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
    bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic topic2 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
    ```
    
2. Test Kafka Setup:
    
    Produce and consume messages:
    
    ```bash
    bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic topic1 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
    # (Write some messages)
    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic topic1 --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
    
    ```
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/12/kafka-metrics-f563e248-c0a2-4397-bee5-e9998393c3bb.webp" alt="" caption="" />### Step 2: Install OpenTelemetry Java Agent

Instrument your Kafka clients with OpenTelemetry for traces and metrics.

1. Verify the Java Agent:
    
    Ensure the agent file exists:
    
    ```bash
    cd kafka-opentelemetry-instrumentation/opentelemetry-javagent
    ls | grep opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
    
    ```
    
2. (Optional) Download the Latest Agent:
