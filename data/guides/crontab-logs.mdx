In Unix-like operating systems, the cron daemon is crucial for automating repetitive tasks. Whether you are running system maintenance scripts, performing data backups, or executing custom scripts, cron jobs ensure that these tasks are performed on schedule without manual intervention. However, to ensure that these automated processes run smoothly and effectively, it is vital to monitor their execution. This is where Crontab logs come into play.

By reading and analyzing Crontab logs, system administrators can verify the successful execution of scheduled tasks, identify any errors or failures, and optimize the performance of their cron jobs. This article explores the importance of Crontab logs, how to access and interpret them, and best practices for monitoring your cron jobs to maintain system reliability and efficiency.

## What are Crontab Logs?

Crontab logs are records generated by the cron daemon on Unix-like operating systems, capturing the execution details of scheduled tasks, known as cron jobs. These logs provide insights into when a cron job was executed, whether it ran successfully, and any errors or output generated during its execution. By examining Crontab logs, system administrators can track and verify the performance of automated tasks.

### Why Monitor Crontab Logs?

Monitoring Crontab logs is crucial for maintaining the reliability and efficiency of automated tasks on Unix-like systems. For instance, consider a backup script scheduled to run nightly. If this script fails silently due to an error, critical data might not be backed up, leading to potential data loss. By regularly checking Crontab logs, system administrators can quickly detect and address such failures, ensuring that all scheduled tasks are executed successfully.

## How to Access and Read Crontab Logs

Accessing and reading Crontab logs involves locating the log files where cron job execution details are stored and using command-line tools to view these logs.

The location of Crontab logs can vary based on the operating system:

- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian): `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/cron.log`
- Linux (Red Hat/CentOS): `/var/log/cron`
- macOS: `/var/log/system.log`
- FreeBSD: `/var/log/cron`
- Windows WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux): Logs are typically found in the same locations as their Linux counterparts depending on the Linux distribution used in WSL. For instance:
  - Ubuntu on WSL: `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/cron.log`
  - Debian on WSL: `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/cron.log`
  - CentOS on WSL: `/var/log/cron`

For WSL, you can access and read these logs using standard Linux commands. However, ensure you have permission to view these log files using `sudo` if required.

### Viewing Crontab Logs via Command Line

You can use command-line tools like `grep`, `tail`, and `less` to view crontab logs.

Below are examples of accessing and reading Crontab logs on different systems.

On Ubuntu/Debian

1. View all cron job entries in syslog:

   ```bash
   grep CRON /var/log/syslog
   ```

   <Figure
     src="/img/guides/2024/07/crontab-logs-9c1cc39e-ffc7-4d9b-bcad-b03d71bdaa34.webp"
     alt="Syslog cronjob entries - Ubuntu"
     caption="Syslog cronjob entries - Ubuntu"
   />
   <br></br>2. View the latest cron log entries using `tail`:

   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep CRON
   ```

   <Figure
     src="/img/guides/2024/07/crontab-logs-Untitled.webp"
     alt="Latest cronjob log entries - Ubuntu"
     caption="Latest cronjob log entries - Ubuntu"
   />
   <br></br>3. Use `less` for detailed log examination:

   ```bash
   less /var/log/syslog | grep CRON
   ```

   <Figure
     src="/img/guides/2024/07/crontab-logs-Untitled%201.webp"
     alt="Detailed cronjob logs - Ubuntu"
     caption="Detailed cronjob logs - Ubuntu"
   />
   <br></br>On Red Hat/CentOS

Similar commands can be followed for RedHat/CentOS operating systems by just changing the file location. Below are the commands:

1. View all cron job entries in the cron log:

   ```bash
   grep CRON /var/log/cron
   ```

   <Figure
     src="/img/guides/2024/07/crontab-logs-Untitled%202.webp"
     alt="Syslog cronjob entries - RedHat"
     caption="Syslog cronjob entries - RedHat"
   />
   <br></br>2. View the latest cron log entries using `tail`:

   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/cron
   ```

   <Figure
     src="/img/guides/2024/07/crontab-logs-image.webp"
     alt="Latest cronjob log entries - RedHat"
     caption="Latest cronjob log entries - RedHat"
   />
   <br></br>3. Use `less` for detailed log examination:

   ```bash
   less /var/log/cron
   ```

   <Figure
     src="/img/guides/2024/07/crontab-logs-image2.webp"
     alt="Detailed cronjob log entries - RedHat"
     caption="Detailed cronjob log entries - RedHat"
   />
   <br></br>

### Creating Custom Crontab Logs

Creating custom Crontab logs involves redirecting the output of your cron jobs to specific log files. This can help organize logs and make monitoring and troubleshooting cron jobs easier.

1. Create a `script.sh` for the cron job using any editor.

   <Figure
     src="/img/guides/2024/07/crontab-logs-Untitled%203.webp"
     alt="Using `vi` editor for custom crontab log script"
     caption="Using `vi` editor for custom crontab log script"
   />
   <br></br>
   ```bash #!/bin/bash echo "Custom Log - $(date): Current time" ```

1. Make the `script.sh` file executable.

   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```

   <Figure
     src="/img/guides/2024/07/crontab-logs-Untitled%204.webp"
     alt="Making custom crontab logs creation script executable"
     caption="Making custom crontab logs creation script executable"
   />
   <br></br>2. Open your Crontab file for editing:

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

   <Figure
     src="/img/guides/2024/07/crontab-logs-Untitled%205.webp"
     alt="Opening Crontab file"
     caption="Opening Crontab file"
   />
   <br></br>3. Add a cron job with custom logging:

   ```bash
   * * * * * /root/script.sh >> /var/log/custom_log.log 2>&1
   ```

   This line schedules `script.sh` to run at 2 AM daily, redirecting both standard output and error output to `custom_log.log`.

### How to Check If a Cron Job Ran Successfully

To check if a cron job ran successfully, you can examine the exit status and the log output. A successful cron job typically exits with a status code of `0`.

1. Check the last 10 logs of the log file:

   ```bash
   tail -n 10 /var/log/custom_log.log
   ```

   <Figure
     src="/img/guides/2024/07/crontab-logs-Untitled%206.webp"
     alt="Latest cronjob log entries"
     caption="Latest cronjob log entries"
   />
   <br></br>2. Add an exit status check in your script:

The script below logs a custom message with the current time, checks if the logging command succeeded, and then logs a success or failure message accordingly with the current date and time.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Custom Log - $(date): Current time"

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "$(date +"[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y]") Script run successfully"
else
    echo "$(date +"[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y]") Script failed"
fi
```

### Checking Timestamps in Log Files

Timestamps in log files indicate when each cron job was executed. This helps verify the execution times and identify any delays or issues.

1. View the latest entries in the log file:

   ```bash
   tail -n 10 /var/log/custom_log.log
   ```

   <Figure
     src="/img/guides/2024/07/crontab-logs-Untitled%207.webp"
     alt="Latest cronjob log entries with timestamp"
     caption="Latest cronjob log entries with timestamp"
   />
   <br></br>Each log entry should include a timestamp indicating when the job was executed.

2. Example log entry with timestamp:

   ```bash
   [Wed Jun 23 02:00:01 2023] Script executed successfully
   ```

### Using Cron Output and Error Logs

Cron jobs can generate both output and error logs. By default, these are emailed to the user running the cron job. You can redirect these outputs to specific files for easier monitoring.

1. Redirect standard output and error to separate files:

   ```bash
   * * * * * /root/script.sh >> /var/log/custom_log.log 2>> /var/log/custom_error.log
   ```

2. Example script with logging:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   echo "Custom Log - $(date): Current time"

   cal
   stamp
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "$(date +"[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y]") Script run successfully"
   else
       echo "$(date +"[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y]") Script failed"
   fi
   ```

3. Check the output and error logs.

   ```bash
   tail -n 10 /var/log/custom_log.log
   ```

   <Figure
     src="/img/guides/2024/07/crontab-logs-Untitled%208.webp"
     alt="Latest entries of cronjob output logs"
     caption="Latest entries of cronjob output logs"
   />
   <br></br>

   ```bash
   tail -n 10 /var/log/custom_error.log
   ```

   <Figure
     src="/img/guides/2024/07/crontab-logs-Untitled%209.webp"
     alt="Latest entries of cronjob error logs"
     caption="Latest entries of cronjob error logs"
   />
   <br></br>By following these practices, you can create custom Crontab logs, check the success of
   your cron jobs, verify timestamps, and effectively manage output and error logs. This helps you
   maintain and troubleshoot your automated tasks efficiently.

## Monitoring Crontab Logs with SigNoz

Monitoring Crontab logs is essential for administrators and developers to ensure the reliable execution of scheduled tasks and to diagnose issues promptly when they arise. SigNoz offers distinct advantages over other monitoring solutions for this purpose.

You can update the access token and endpoint with the values specified in the Otel-collector Setup step.

Note: Crontab logs are not added by default to the system logs, so you need to define the output file where your crontab logs are stored under the `filelog` section.

1. To run otel-collector, run the following command inside the `otelcol-contrib` directory:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid

Modify the `rsyslog.conf` file

1. Open your `rsyslog.conf` file present inside `/etc/` by running the following command :

```bash
sudo vim /etc/rsyslog.conf
```

1. Update your `rsyslog.conf` file with the following content

```bash
template(
  name="UTCTraditionalForwardFormat"
  type="string"
  string="<%PRI%>%TIMESTAMP:::date-utc% %HOSTNAME% %syslogtag:1:32%%msg:::sp-if-no-1st-sp%%msg%"
)

*.* action(type="omfwd" target="0.0.0.0" port="54527" protocol="tcp" template="UTCTraditionalForwardFormat")
```

Note: Here, it is assumed that you are running the Otel binary on the same host. If not, the value of the target might change depending on your environment.

<br></br>1. Check the status of your service. Make sure your service is in an active state.{' '}

```bash
sudo systemctl status rsyslog.service
```

<br></br>Once things are up and running, you can click on `Done` button of the SigNoz steps and you
will be redirected to `Logs Explorer` where you will see your logs getting updated.

<br></br>You can expand the logs and see the various attributes associated with them. You can also
filter logs based on the attributes and their values.

<br></br>For example, say you redirect output from various files to SigNoz , and now you want to
filter logs associated with a particular logfile, you can filter based on query
`log.file.name=custom_log.log` or any other file name.

<br></br>From the below image, you can see that no data is returned as there are no logs associated
with the file name `custom.log` .
