SSH logs are critical for detecting unauthorized access attempts and maintaining system security. If you're managing servers, you know how proper SSH log monitoring can mean the difference between catching a breach early and discovering it weeks later.

Whether you're managing a handful of servers or hundreds, this guide will help you master SSH log analysis, from basic log locations to advanced threat detection strategies.

## Understanding SSH Log Fundamentals

SSH logs capture every authentication attempt, connection, and session activity through the SSH daemon (`sshd`). These logs are your audit trail for:

- **Authentication events**: Successful and failed login attempts
- **Connection metadata**: Source IPs, ports, session duration
- **User activity**: Session starts, disconnections, privilege changes
- **Protocol details**: Key exchanges, cipher negotiations, errors

### Anatomy of SSH Log Entries

Every SSH log entry follows a structured format:

```
Jan 23 14:30:15 server01 sshd[12345]: Accepted publickey for admin from 192.168.1.100 port 54321 ssh2: RSA SHA256:abc123...
```

Breaking this down:
- **Timestamp**: `Jan 23 14:30:15`
- **Hostname**: `server01` 
- **Process**: `sshd[12345]` (daemon with PID)
- **Event**: `Accepted publickey`
- **User**: `admin`
- **Source**: `192.168.1.100 port 54321`
- **Method**: `publickey` with key fingerprint

## SSH Log Locations by Operating System

Finding SSH logs depends on your OS and logging setup:

### Linux Systems

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
# Primary location
tail -f /var/log/auth.log

# Using systemd journal
journalctl -u ssh -f
```

**RHEL/CentOS/Rocky:**
```bash
# Primary location  
tail -f /var/log/secure

# Using systemd journal
journalctl -u sshd -f
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
# Primarily systemd journal
journalctl -u sshd.service -f

# Alternative
tail -f /var/log/auth.log
```

### Other Platforms

**macOS:**
```bash
tail -f /var/log/system.log | grep ssh
```

**FreeBSD:**
```bash
tail -f /var/log/auth.log
```

### Custom Log Paths

Configure custom logging by modifying `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```bash
# Set custom facility
SyslogFacility LOCAL7

# Route to custom file in rsyslog
echo "local7.*    /var/log/ssh.log" >> /etc/rsyslog.conf
systemctl restart rsyslog sshd
```

## Configuring SSH Logging for Security

### Adjusting Log Verbosity

Control SSH log detail with the `LogLevel` directive:

```bash
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config
LogLevel VERBOSE

# Available levels: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG1-3
```

**Recommendations:**
- **Production**: `INFO` or `VERBOSE` 
- **Security monitoring**: `VERBOSE`
- **Troubleshooting**: `DEBUG` (temporarily)

### Syslog Facility Configuration

Direct SSH logs to specific facilities:

```bash
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config
SyslogFacility AUTHPRIV

# Options: AUTH, AUTHPRIV (recommended), LOCAL0-7
```

Restart SSH after changes:
```bash
systemctl restart sshd
```

## Modern Log Analysis with journalctl

For systemd systems, `journalctl` provides powerful filtering:

```bash
# View SSH service logs
journalctl -u ssh.service

# Real-time monitoring
journalctl -u ssh.service -f

# Last hour's events
journalctl -u ssh.service --since "1 hour ago"

# Filter by user
journalctl -u ssh.service | grep "user admin"

# Failed attempts only
journalctl -u ssh.service | grep "Failed"

# With ISO timestamps
journalctl -u ssh.service -o short-iso
```

## Security Threat Detection Techniques

### Identifying Brute Force Attacks

Find IPs with multiple failed attempts:
```bash
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | \
awk '{print $(NF-3)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
```

Show recent failed attempts:
```bash
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | \
grep "$(date --date='1 day ago' '+%b %d')\|$(date '+%b %d')"
```

### Detecting Unusual Patterns

Check off-hours access:
```bash
grep "Accepted" /var/log/auth.log | \
awk '$3 < "09:00:00" || $3 > "17:00:00" {print}'
```

Monitor direct root logins (should be disabled):
```bash
grep "root" /var/log/auth.log | grep "Accepted"
```

### Privilege Escalation Monitoring

Track sudo usage after SSH login:
```bash
grep -E "(Accepted|sudo)" /var/log/auth.log | grep -A5 -B5 "sudo"
```

## Automated Protection with Fail2ban

Fail2ban is an intrusion prevention tool that monitors log files and automatically bans IP addresses showing suspicious activity like repeated failed login attempts. It works by scanning SSH logs in real-time and temporarily blocking IPs that exceed defined failure thresholds.

### Installation and Setup

```bash
# Install fail2ban
sudo apt install fail2ban  # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo yum install fail2ban  # RHEL/CentOS

# Basic SSH jail
cat > /etc/fail2ban/jail.local << EOF
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3
bantime = 1h
findtime = 10m
EOF

systemctl start fail2ban
systemctl enable fail2ban
```

### Advanced Configuration

```bash
# Custom jail with notifications
cat > /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/ssh-custom.conf << EOF
[sshd-custom]
enabled = true
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 5
bantime = 24h
findtime = 30m
ignoreip = 192.168.1.0/24 10.0.0.0/8
action = iptables-multiport[name=SSH, port="ssh", protocol=tcp]
         sendmail-whois[name=SSH, dest=admin@company.com]
EOF
```

### Managing Fail2ban

```bash
# Check banned IPs
fail2ban-client status sshd

# Unban IP
fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip 192.168.1.100

# View logs
journalctl -u fail2ban -f
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Missing Log Files

Check SSH service status:
```bash
systemctl status sshd
journalctl -u sshd --no-pager
```

Verify logging configuration:
```bash
grep -E "^(SyslogFacility|LogLevel)" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Test with verbose SSH:
```bash
ssh -v user@localhost
```

### Permission Issues

Check log file permissions:
```bash
ls -la /var/log/auth.log

# Add user to log group
sudo usermod -a -G adm username  # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo usermod -a -G wheel username  # RHEL/CentOS
```

### High Log Volume

Configure size-based rotation:
```bash
# /etc/logrotate.d/ssh-size
/var/log/ssh.log {
    size 100M
    rotate 10
    compress
    create 640 syslog adm
}
```

Reduce verbosity:
```bash
sed -i 's/LogLevel VERBOSE/LogLevel INFO/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
systemctl restart sshd
```

## Centralized SSH Log Management

For infrastructure-scale monitoring, centralize your SSH logs using modern observability platforms.

## SSH Security Hardening

Effective SSH log monitoring is only part of a comprehensive security strategy. Beyond analyzing authentication events, you must proactively secure your SSH service itself to reduce the attack surface and minimize the volume of suspicious activities that appear in your logs.

The following hardening measures work hand-in-hand with log monitoring - while robust logging helps you detect threats, proper configuration prevents many attacks from succeeding in the first place. This layered approach significantly reduces both security risks and the noise in your authentication logs.

### Essential Configuration

```bash
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config - Security baseline
Protocol 2
Port 2222                    # Non-standard port
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
MaxAuthTries 3
LoginGraceTime 60
MaxStartups 3

# Restrict access
AllowUsers admin deploy
AllowGroups ssh-users

# Enhanced logging
LogLevel VERBOSE
SyslogFacility AUTHPRIV
```

### Network-Level Protection

```bash
# Restrict SSH with iptables
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -j DROP

# Rate limiting
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -m recent --name ssh --set
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -m recent --name ssh --rcheck --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 -j DROP
```

## Performance and Retention

### Log Rotation Strategies

```bash
# /etc/logrotate.d/ssh-logs
/var/log/ssh.log {
    daily
    rotate 365        # 1-year retention
    compress
    delaycompress
    create 640 syslog adm
}
```

### Compliance Requirements

- **PCI-DSS**: 1 year minimum
- **SOX**: 7 years for financial data
- **HIPAA**: 6 years for healthcare
- **GDPR**: As long as necessary
