### Core Features of Sentry

Sentry is best known for real-time error tracking and application performance monitoring (APM). Its core features include:

1. **Error and Exception Monitoring**: Catches application errors in real-time, intelligently grouping recurring issues while providing stack traces, breadcrumbs, and contextual data.
2. **Performance Tracing**: Monitors transaction performance with distributed tracing capabilities, measuring request latency and identifying bottlenecks.
3. **Release Tracking**: Integrates with version control and CI/CD systems to track which errors were introduced in specific deployments.
4. **Rich Integration Ecosystem**: Supports numerous languages and frameworks while connecting to collaboration tools (Slack, Teams), alerting systems (PagerDuty), and issue trackers (Jira).
5. **User Experience Monitoring**: Provides Real User Monitoring (RUM) with Session Replay capabilities.
6. **Custom Metrics**: Allows tracking of application-specific numeric values that can be correlated with transaction traces.

In summary, Sentry’s feature set centers on observing application behavior – primarily errors and performance within the code – and integrating that information into the developer workflow. It shines in telling developers what went wrong in the code and where, which is invaluable during continuous delivery.

## Key Components of Sentry's Observability Offering

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%201.webp" alt="Key Components of Sentry's Observability Offering" caption="Key Components of Sentry's Observability Offering" />

### Error Tracking

Sentry provides robust error tracking and crash reporting by integrating with your application's runtime environment through its SDKs. Once integrated, Sentry automatically captures unhandled exceptions and errors, sending detailed reports in real-time.

To help developers quickly identify, categorize, and resolve issues, Sentry offers the following capabilities:

1. **Captures exceptions in real-time**

Sentry ensures that critical errors don't go unnoticed by capturing exceptions as they occur. The SDK provides methods to explicitly report errors, log events, and add custom messages.

```python
def main():
    try:
        # Trigger an error intentionally
        1 / 0
    except Exception as e:
        sentry_sdk.capture_exception(e)
```

Run the script with:

```python
python app.py
```

This will send the captured exception to Sentry.

Next, navigate to Sentry’s dashboard to view the captured issue.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%202.webp" alt="Issues on Sentry" caption="Issues on Sentry" />

Click on the error to explore detailed insights, including stack traces, affected environments, and additional debugging information.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%203.webp" alt="Detailed Issues tab" caption="Detailed Issues tab" />

2. **Groups similar errors to avoid alert fatigue**

Sentry prevents alert fatigue by intelligently grouping similar errors using **fingerprints**. A fingerprint is a 
way to uniquely identify an event, and all events have one. Events with the same fingerprint are grouped together into an issue.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%204.webp" alt="Fingerprinting on sentry" caption="Fingerprinting on sentry" />

You can set up custom grouping rules under **[Project] > Settings > Issue Grouping > Fingerprint Rules**. Sentry reviews all stack trace frames and applies the fingerprint if an event matches the rule's conditions.

3. **Custom Tagging**

Sentry allows you to tag events with feature flag data for better debugging and performance monitoring. Feature flags are a technique used in software development to enable or disable specific features of an application at runtime without changing the code. They provide flexibility in controlling the availability of features for specific users or environments, often without requiring a redeployment.

By tagging events with feature flags, you can easily isolate and analyze issues tied to specific feature configurations.

**Practical Scenario Example**:
Let’s say you’re rolling out a new feature (e.g., a widget) and you want to track its performance, or any errors associated with it. You can tag events with the status of the `show_widget` feature flag. Then, when an issue occurs, you can easily filter to see whether users who encountered the issue had the widget enabled or not.

```python
from sentry_sdk import start_transaction, capture_exception
from sentry_sdk import set_tag

sentry_sdk.init(
    ...
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,  # Enable profiling
)

def set_feature_flag_tag(user):
    # Tagging the 'show_widget' feature flag to track its state
    show_widget = user.get("showWidget", False)  
    set_tag("show_widget", show_widget)
    
# Simulating a user and checking their feature flag status
user = {"id": 123, "username": "test_user", "showWidget": True}  

set_feature_flag_tag(user)

# Start a transaction for performance monitoring
with start_transaction(op="task", name="feature-check"):
    print("Performing some task..."

```

The `set_feature_flag_tag()` function assigns a Sentry tag for the `show_widget` feature flag, indicating whether the user has it enabled (`True`) or not (`False`). Meanwhile, `start_transaction` initiates a new transaction, representing a unit of work in the application. It takes an `op` (operation type) and a `name` (`"feature-check"`) to provide context. Using the `with` statement ensures the transaction starts when the block begins and ends automatically when it finishes.

You can filter issues or transactions based on tags. For example, you can filter issues to see only those that were triggered by users with the widget enabled (`show_widget = True`)

Let’s head to sentry’s dashboard in trace view

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%208.webp" alt="Trace View Sentry" caption="Trace View Sentry" />

Similarly, you can also view it on the Transactions Summary page

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%209.webp" alt="Transaction Summary Sentry" caption="Transaction Summary Sentry" />

By using the feature flag in tags, you can answer questions like:

- **"Is the issue happening only for users with the widget enabled?"**
- **"Are there performance issues when the widget is shown?"**
- **"Which combination of feature flags is causing this error?"**

This allows you to isolate the root cause of an issue based on the specific features or configurations that are active.

### Crash Reporting

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%2010.webp" alt="Feedback collected via the Crash-Report Modal" caption="Feedback collected via the Crash-Report Modal" />

Sentry's Crash-Report Modal lets users submit feedback after they encounter errors. The modal collects the user's name, email address, and a description of what occurred, pairing this feedback with the original event for additional insights.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%2011.webp" alt="User Feedback: Crash Reporting Modal" caption="User Feedback: Crash Reporting Modal" />

### Performance Monitoring

While error tracking shows what went wrong, performance monitoring reveals why it happened and how it affects users. Sentry tracks slowdowns, measuring metrics like throughput and latency while mapping error impact across services. It also captures **distributed traces** to analyze service performance in depth.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%2012.webp" alt="Performance Tab in Sentry" caption="Performance Tab in Sentry" />

Using this information, you can trace issues back through services to identify poorly performing code, determine whether application performance is improving or degrading, and compare release performance over time.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%2013.webp" alt="Sentry Performance Transactions Summary (Credit: Sentry)" caption="Sentry Performance Transactions Summary (Credit: Sentry)" />

### Tracing

In microservices architectures, distributed tracing **stitches together the journey** of a request as it moves through different parts of the system. This allows developers to:

- Identify which service or API call is causing latency
- Track dependencies between services
- Measure execution time across various parts of the stack

Sentry's SDKs automatically instrument application code to **capture spans and transactions**, which are fundamental to distributed tracing.

```python
# Example of spans within a transaction
with start_transaction(op="task", name="my_task"):
    with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="subtask", description="subtask_1"):
        print("Subtask 1 is being executed...")

    with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="subtask", description="subtask_2"):
        print("Subtask 2 is being executed...")
```

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%2015.webp" alt="Trace View Page" caption="Trace View Page" />

The Trace View allows you to drill down into a single trace to visualize transactions and spans, making debugging slow services and identifying bottlenecks faster and easier.

### Release Tracking & Deployment Insights

- **Track Issues by Release Version**: Sentry links errors and performance problems to specific release versions.
- **Automated Release Management**: By integrating with version control and CI/CD pipelines, Sentry provides real-time visibility into deployment health.
- **Commit Association for Debugging**: Sentry's release tracking includes commit association, enabling teams to identify the exact commits and authors responsible for issues.

### User Feedback

Sentry provides two primary methods for collecting user feedback:

1. **User Feedback Widget** – Can be placed anywhere in your web application, allowing users to report issues even if the application hasn't crashed.
2. **Crash-Report Modal** – Automatically appears when an application crashes, prompting users to submit feedback immediately.

Using **Session Replay** alongside the **User Feedback Widget** provides a visual representation of what the user experienced before submitting their feedback.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%2018.webp" alt="User Feedback in Sentry (Credit: Sentry)" caption="User Feedback in Sentry (Credit: Sentry)" />

**Compatibility and Integration**

Sentry’s feedback collection features work with all browser-based applications, including Static websites, Single-page applications (SPAs) and Server-side-rendered applications

Sentry also supports a wide range of frameworks, such as Django, Spring, ASP.NET, Laravel, Express, and Rails, making it a versatile solution for developers across different ecosystems.

**How the Sentry SDK Powers Feedback Collection**

The Sentry SDK injects the **User Feedback Widget** directly into the client’s browser. This functionality is built into `@sentry/browser` and Sentry’s various browser framework SDKs, ensuring a seamless experience for both developers and end-users.

## The Strengths of Sentry in Modern DevOps Practices

Sentry excels in several areas that are crucial for modern DevOps teams:

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%2019.webp" alt="Strengths of Sentry in Modern DevOps Practices" caption="Strengths of Sentry in Modern DevOps Practices" />

### Real-Time Visibility

Sentry provides immediate error notifications, helping teams respond quickly to production issues and minimize mean time to detection (MTTD). 

If you have Sentry's default issue alert i.e. `Alert me on every new issue` turned on for the project(s) with user feedback set up, then you should automatically get alerted every time new user feedback comes in via the User Feedback Widget.

If you don't have Sentry's default issue alert turned on, follow these steps to set up alerts for every new feedback:

**Step 1:** Create a New Alert Rule in Sentry.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%2020.webp" alt="Sentry Alert" caption="Sentry Alert" />

**Step 2:** Scroll to the "Set conditions" section, set the "IF" filter to your required condition, and choose which actions to perform in the “THEN” filter.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%2021.webp" alt="Sentry New Alert Rule" caption="Sentry New Alert Rule" />

**Step 3:** Add an alert name and owner. To get notifications when crash-report feedback comes in, make sure to turn on `Enable Crash Report Notifications` in Settings > Projects > [Your Project Name] > User Feedback.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%2022.webp" alt="Sentry User Feedback" caption="Sentry User Feedback" />

### Detailed Debugging Context

Sentry provides two key debugging tools: breadcrumbs for tracking event sequences leading up to an error and trace context for linking transactions and errors across services.

```python
sentry_sdk.add_breadcrumb(
    category="task",
    message="Starting transaction simulation",
    level="info"
)
```

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%2023.webp" alt="Sentry Breadcrumb section" caption="Sentry Breadcrumb section" />

Trace context delivers crucial details that allow Sentry to link multiple transactions, spans, and errors into a unified trace.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%2024.webp" alt="Trace View in Sentry" caption="Trace View in Sentry" />

### Cross-Platform Support

Sentry provides robust SDKs for both front-end frameworks and back-end languages, along with mobile support. With code-level observability, Sentry simplifies diagnosing issues while offering continuous insights into your application's code health.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry-observability-image%2026.webp" alt="SKDs supported by sentry" caption="SKDs supported by sentry" />

### Integration with DevOps Toolchains

Sentry integrates seamlessly with **Slack, Jira, GitHub,** and CI/CD systems to accelerate error resolution and streamline development workflows. Key integration features include:

- **Automated Issue Tracking & Resolution**: Sentry can automatically create issues in Jira when critical errors occur and identify suspect commits.
- **GitHub Integration**: Enables stack trace linking, PR comments with issue details, and automatic issue resolution through commit references.

By integrating Sentry into your DevOps toolchain, you gain full visibility into code changes and their impact on application health, leading to faster debugging and more efficient collaboration.

## Limitations of Sentry in Comprehensive Observability

While Sentry excels in error tracking and application performance monitoring, it has certain limitations in providing comprehensive observability across complex, distributed systems:

1. **No Native Log Aggregation**
    
    Sentry lacks native log aggregation features, which are essential for analyzing large volumes of logs across various services. This necessitates the integration of dedicated log management solutions, such as the Elastic Stack or Loki, to achieve comprehensive log analysis and correlation
    
2. **Primary Focus on Error Tracking and Application Performance**
    
    Sentry primarily concentrates on error tracking and application performance monitoring, without extending to infrastructure-level metrics like CPU, memory, or network usage. It also lacks built-in host monitoring capabilities for container orchestration platforms, such as Kubernetes node metrics, which are vital for maintaining the health and performance of the underlying infrastructure
    
3. **Limited Distributed Tracing:** 
    
    Sentry's distributed tracing capabilities are relatively basic compared to specialized tools like Jaeger or SigNoz. In intricate microservice architectures, this can hinder the ability to trace requests seamlessly across multiple services, making it challenging to diagnose performance bottlenecks and latency issues effectively.

4. **Potential Over-Reliance on Client-Side Instrumentation**
    
    Implementing Sentry requires adding its SDKs to each service or client within the application. This approach can lead to potential gaps in monitoring if the instrumentation is incorrectly configured or omitted, resulting in missed critical data and incomplete observability
    

<KeyPointCallout title="Final Verdict">
In short, Sentry’s limitations mean that **by itself** it provides an incomplete picture. It covers the application layer superbly but doesn’t give the birds-eye view of the entire system’s health. DevOps professionals often need to know not just that an error happened (which Sentry tells you), but also why – which might involve looking at database load, memory pressure, or a spike in user traffic, none of which Sentry tracks. Thus, Sentry is typically one piece of an observability suite, not the whole.

To achieve full-stack observability, it's often necessary to complement Sentry with other specialized tools that offer advanced distributed tracing, log aggregation, and infrastructure monitoring capabilities. 
</KeyPointCallout>

## Comparing Sentry to Full-Stack Observability Solutions

Sentry is a robust application monitoring tool that excels in error tracking and performance monitoring. To understand its position within the observability landscape, let's compare it to full-stack observability solutions:

| **Feature** | **Sentry** | **Full-Stack Solutions (SigNoz, New Relic, Datadog, etc.)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Focuses on application-level error tracking and performance monitoring. | Provides end-to-end monitoring, including infrastructure, logs, and APM. |
| Cost Model | Event-based pricing; cost-effective for small to mid-sized teams. | New Relic scales with data ingestion/users; advanced features can be costly. <br /> Datadog charges per host and feature usage; costs rise with infrastructure growth. <br /> SigNoz offers usage based [pricing](/pricing).|
| Metrics | Limited to application-level performance data. | Collects system-wide, container, and infrastructure metrics. |
| Logs | Captures exceptions but lacks full log management. | Provides centralized log aggregation and analysis. |
