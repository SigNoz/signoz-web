# üìå Overview

This is a step-by-step guide to help you migrate from normalized, underscore-based metric names (e.g., `system_memory_usage`) to unnormalized naming conventions (e.g., `system.memory.usage`). This change aligns with the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions and enables better namespacing, and cross-signal compatibility.

Currently, the SigNoz OpenTelemetry Collector normalizes metric names by replacing dots (`.`) with underscores (`_`)‚Äîboth in metric names and attributes. This guide will help you adopt the dot notation consistently throughout your observability pipeline.

## üîç Why We Are Migrating

Previously, PromQL did not support the dot (`.`) character in metric names, which required us to normalize all metric names in the OpenTelemetry Collector by replacing dots with underscores (`_`). This ensured compatibility with PromQL queries and prevented query failures.

However, recent updates to PromQL now support a broader set of UTF-8 characters‚Äîincluding the dot (`.`). This removes the need for such normalization and allows us to align with the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions, which recommend using dot-separated naming for better structure and consistency.

## üì¶ Migration Plan

### 1. Dual Export Phase (Transition Period)

We have introduced a new exporter: `signozclickhousemetrics`, that doesn't normalizes the metric names and the labels (`system.memory.usage`).

Both exporters (the existing ClickHouse metrics exporter and the new `signozclickhousemetrics`) will run in parallel during this phase.

This allows time for dashboard and alert migration while ensuring no data loss or query breakage.

### 2. Dashboard and Alert Migration

During the transition phase, we will provide scripts and tools to help you migrate your dashboards and alerts from normalized (`_`) metrics to unnormalized (`.`) metrics.

We will also offer community support and documentation to assist with this process.

### 3. Cutover and Deprecation

Once the data for both naming formats has existed in your system for at least one full default retention cycle, we will deprecate and remove the old exporter.

At this point:
- Underscore-based metric names will be deprecated.
- Only the `signozclickhousemetrics` exporter will be supported moving forward.
- All dashboards, alerts, and custom queries should use the unnormalized exclusively.
- For those community users who have higher retention in metrics data, we will help with the scripts to converts the old (_) data to new non normalized data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Resource Impact

Running both exporters simultaneously will result in a temporary increase in CPU and memory usage:

- **OpenTelemetry Collector:** ~25%-30% increase in CPU and memory usage
- **ClickHouse:** ~25%-30% increase in ingestion and processing load

This is expected and temporary, only for the duration of the dual-export phase.
