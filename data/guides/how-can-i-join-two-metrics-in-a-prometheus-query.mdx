Joining two metrics in a Prometheus query allows you to correlate data from different sources, providing deeper insights into your system's behavior. This process involves using PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) to combine metrics based on their labels and apply operations to the resulting data. By mastering metric joining, you'll unlock powerful analysis capabilities for your monitoring and observability needs.

## Understanding Prometheus Metrics and PromQL Basics

Prometheus metrics form the foundation of monitoring in many modern systems. These time-series data points represent various aspects of your application and infrastructure performance. PromQL, the query language designed for Prometheus, enables you to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze these metrics effectively.

Labels play a crucial role in Prometheus metrics. They provide additional context to the data, allowing for fine-grained filtering and grouping. When joining metrics, these labels become the key to establishing relationships between different data sets.

### Types of Metrics in Prometheus

Prometheus supports several metric types:

- **Counter metrics**: These always increase over time and are useful for tracking totals, such as the number of requests processed.
- **Gauge metrics**: They can increase or decrease and represent current values, like memory usage.
- **Histogram and Summary metrics**: These provide distribution of values over time, often used for measuring request durations or response sizes.

## The Need for Joining Metrics in Prometheus

Combining data from multiple metrics becomes necessary in various scenarios:

1. Calculating ratios or percentages (e.g., error rate as a fraction of total requests)
2. Correlating application performance with infrastructure metrics
3. Comparing metrics from different services or components
4. Creating complex alert conditions based on multiple data sources

By joining metrics, you gain more comprehensive insights that aren't possible when querying single metrics in isolation. This approach allows for a holistic view of your system's health and performance.

## Techniques for Joining Metrics in Prometheus Queries

### Vector Matching

Vector matching is the primary method for joining metrics in PromQL. It allows you to combine time series based on their label sets. Here's a basic example:

```
http_requests_total / http_requests_total{status="200"}
```

This query calculates the ratio of total HTTP requests to successful (status 200) requests.

### Label Matching

To join metrics effectively, you need to understand how to match labels between different time series. PromQL uses label matching to determine which series to combine. For example:

```
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (service) /
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status="200"}[5m])) by (service)
```

This query calculates the error rate for each service by matching the `service` label.

### Mathematical Operations

Once metrics are joined, you can apply various mathematical operations to derive meaningful insights:

```
100 * (1 - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes)
```

This query calculates the percentage of used memory by combining available and total memory metrics.

### Advanced Joining Techniques

For more complex scenarios, PromQL offers advanced joining modifiers:

- `group_left`: Used for many-to-one relationships
- `group_right`: Used for one-to-many relationships

Example using `group_left`:

```
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (service) /
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status="200"}[5m])) by (service) *
on(service) group_left(slo_target) slo_targets
```

This query joins the error rate calculation with a separate `slo_targets` metric to include the SLO target in the result.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Joining Two Metrics in a Prometheus Query

1. Identify the metrics you want to join (e.g., `http_requests_total` and `http_errors_total`)
2. Analyze the label sets of both metrics to find common labels
3. Construct the basic query structure:

```
<metric1> <operator> <metric2>
```

1. Add label matching criteria:

```
<metric1> <operator> on(label1, label2) <metric2>

```

1. Apply additional operations or aggregations:

```
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (service) /
sum(rate(http_errors_total[5m])) by (service)

```

This query calculates the error rate per service by joining request and error metrics.

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Mismatched label sets**: Ensure that the labels you're matching on exist in both metrics
- **Performance issues**: Be cautious when joining high-cardinality metrics; use aggregation to reduce the number of time series
- **Time alignment**: When joining metrics with different scrape intervals, use the `timestamp()` function to align the time series

## Real-World Examples of Joined Metric Queries

1. **Resource utilization percentage**:

```
100 - (avg by(instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100)

```

1. **Error rate with traffic metrics**:

```
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) /
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) * 100

```

1. **Correlating application latency with CPU usage**:

```
avg(http_request_duration_seconds) by (service) /
on(instance) group_left avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!="idle"}[5m])) by (instance)

```

## Key Takeaways

- Joining metrics in Prometheus enables complex and insightful queries
- Label matching is crucial for successful metric joining
- Vector matching and operations are the primary tools for joining in PromQL
- Consider performance implications when joining large or high-cardinality metrics
- Practice and experimentation are key to mastering metric joining in Prometheus

## FAQs

### What is the difference between inner and outer joins in PromQL?

PromQL doesn't have explicit inner and outer join operations. Instead, it uses vector matching with modifiers like `group_left` and `group_right` to achieve similar results. The default behavior is similar to an inner join, where only matching elements are included in the result.

### Can I join more than two metrics in a single Prometheus query?

Yes, you can join multiple metrics by chaining operations. For example:

```
(metric1 / metric2) * metric3
```

### How do I handle time alignment when joining metrics with different scrape intervals?

Use the `timestamp()` function to align time series before joining. For example:

```
metric1 and timestamp(metric2)
```

### Are there any performance concerns when joining high-cardinality metrics?

Yes, joining high-cardinality metrics can lead to performance issues and increased resource usage. To mitigate this:

1. Use aggregation to reduce the number of time series before joining
2. Apply filters to limit the scope of the join
3. Consider using recording rules for frequently used joins
