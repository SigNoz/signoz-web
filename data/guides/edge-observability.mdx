Edge observability lets you monitor and understand system behavior at edge locations in real-time. It extends traditional monitoring capabilities to the network edge—where your applications interact directly with users and devices. Unlike centralized monitoring, edge observability focuses on collecting and analyzing telemetry data at distributed edge locations.

## Understanding Edge Observability

Edge computing moves processing and data storage closer to where data originates. This shift requires a new approach to monitoring.

Edge observability combines three key telemetry types:

/>

- Metrics: Numerical measurements of system performance (like CPU utilization, memory usage, or response times). Metrics provide a quick overview of health and performance and help detect real-time anomalies.
- Logs: Records of events, errors, and transactions that occur at the edge. Logs capture detailed information on each step of a process, enabling deeper troubleshooting and audit trails for events that might impact performance.
- Traces: End-to-end tracking of requests as they move across services and devices. Traces are essential for understanding dependencies, identifying bottlenecks, and following data flow across distributed systems.

### Key Distributed Environments for Edge Observability

Traditional monitoring focuses on centralized data centers, while edge observability extends monitoring to distributed edge locations like:

Observability tools track resource utilization, application performance, and the interaction between edge nodes and the cloud, ensuring seamless operation and minimal latency in hybrid cloud-edge environments.
- Distributed Database and Data Pipeline Systems: Distributed databases and data pipelines handle large-scale real-time data processing across edge locations. Observability ensures data consistency, availability, and performance by monitoring replication status, pipeline health, and the flow of data from edge devices to processing systems.
- Content Delivery Nodes (CDN): Observing content delivery at the edge helps ensure seamless, low-latency content access for end-users, particularly in video streaming and web applications, where user experience relies on fast load times.
- Network Edge Platforms: Network edge platforms manage services and applications at the network's edge, including SD-WAN and 5G technologies. Observability tools monitor network traffic, connectivity health, and security, ensuring low-latency communication, optimal resource allocation, and protection against potential threats in real-time applications.
- Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC): MEC brings computation and storage closer to the end-user, often leveraging 5G networks. Edge observability in MEC involves monitoring the performance of edge nodes, network slices, and real-time applications, ensuring low-latency and high-quality service for critical applications like autonomous vehicles and smart cities.

## Traditional v/s Edge Observability

## Core Components of Edge Observability

Edge observability involves monitoring and analyzing performance data from distributed edge environments. These environments require a different approach to tracking system health, user interactions, and the flow of requests, as edge devices are often remote and have limited resources. Let's break down the core components:

### 1. Distributed Tracing

Distributed tracing allows you to track the journey of a request as it moves through various services, including those at the edge. At the edge, each service or device (like IoT sensors, mobile network servers, or POS systems) processes a portion of the data. Tracing helps to understand the end-to-end flow and time taken across each stage.

<Figure
  src="/img/guides/2024/11/edge-observability-56646277-3e3d-45c1-b37a-05fd5f1a5339.webp"
  alt="Trace Request Flow Diagram"
  caption="Trace Request Flow Diagram"
/>

Let’s see how we can propagate trace context in a distributed system through the following code snippet:

```python
# Example trace context propagation
@tracer.start_span('edge_transaction')
def process_at_edge():
    # Process data locally
    edge_result = local_processing()

    # Forward trace context
    context = tracer.get_current_span().context
    send_to_central(edge_result, context)
```

When a request is processed at the edge, a span (`@tracer.start_span('edge_transaction')`) is started to represent the transaction's processing. This trace context is then forwarded to the central system to maintain visibility over the request's entire lifecycle.

In the above code snippet,

- `local_processing()` refers to the data handling done on the edge device, while
- `send_to_central()` propagates the trace context to the central system, ensuring end-to-end visibility from edge to cloud.

### 2. Metrics Collection

Metrics collection at the edge is crucial for measuring performance and resource usage locally, without sending large amounts of data back to the central system. Metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and request latency help in understanding how each edge device is performing.

```yaml
# Example edge metrics configuration
metrics:
  collection:
    interval: 10s
    edge_points:
      - cpu_usage
      - memory_usage
      - request_latency
    aggregation: local
```

The YAML configuration sets a collection interval (`10s`) for key metrics such as `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, and `request_latency`, with local aggregation to prevent network overload and provide timely insights at the edge. Aggregation helps reduce network overload by combining data before sending, minimizing the volume of transmitted information while still providing timely insights at the edge.

In this setup, the edge device gathers metrics every 10 seconds, performing aggregation locally to reduce network load and optimize edge resource use. This approach is especially valuable in bandwidth-constrained environments.

### 3. Log Management

Log management at the edge involves capturing detailed logs of events, errors, or transactions that happen on edge devices. Logs are essential for troubleshooting and understanding system behaviors at the local level, especially when devices are remote or experience network issues.

The Python example configures a logger to handle local storage, log compression, error-level thresholds, and retention.

```python
# Example edge logging
logger.config({
    'local_storage': True,
    'compression': True,
    'forward_threshold': 'ERROR',
    'retention_days': 7
})

```

In this example,

`local_storage: True` enables logs to be stored directly on the device, reducing the need for continuous network communication.

`compression: True` saves storage by compressing log files.

`forward_threshold: 'ERROR'` ensures that only error-level logs are sent to the central system, highlighting critical issues.

`retention_days: 7` sets the local log retention period to seven days before deletion.

## Why Edge Observability Matters

Edge observability provides critical benefits:

- Faster Response: It allows data to be processed and monitored locally at the network's edge (close to data source), which means there’s minimal latency. Since it reduces the time data needs to travel to and from a central server, edge observability supports immediate actions and critical decision-making in time-sensitive scenarios
- Cost Reduction: Edge devices can process data locally, reducing expensive data transfers to the cloud, especially for high-bandwidth tasks like video streaming and IoT applications.
- Enhanced Performance: By processing data locally, edge devices reduce the load on central infrastructure, ensuring smoother operation even with limited connectivity.
- Optimized Bandwidth Usage: Observability reduces unnecessary data transmission by processing and filtering data locally, ensuring only essential insights are sent to the central system, which helps optimize bandwidth, especially in remote or limited connectivity environments.
- Enhanced Data Privacy and Security: By keeping sensitive data at the edge and only sending necessary information to central systems, observability reduces the risk of data exposure and enhances security, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
- Scalability Across Distributed Environments: Observability enables scalable monitoring in distributed environments by processing data locally at the edge, allowing systems to grow without overloading centralized infrastructure.

## Implementing Edge Observability

Implementing edge observability involves setting up the necessary infrastructure, defining key performance indicators, and establishing monitoring protocols to ensure visibility into the health and performance of distributed edge environments.

<Figure

  alt="Steps to implement edge observability"
  caption="Steps to implement edge observability"
/>

The following steps are crucial for successfully adopting edge observability:

### 1. Setup Infrastructure

This first step focuses on establishing the fundamental architecture for monitoring at the edge.

- Deploy Collectors at Edge Locations: Edge collectors are lightweight agents or services deployed on edge devices to capture telemetry data. After gathering data locally, these collectors either send it to a central system or process it on-site, depending on the needs.
  For example, you could deploy a collector on each edge node to monitor CPU and memory usage, log specific events, and trace requests as they flow through the edge system.
- Configure Data Retention Policies: Given the limited storage capacity of edge devices, data retention policies are important to ensure that only relevant data is stored locally for the appropriate amount of time. It's crucial to determine how long data should be kept (e.g., logs from the past 7 days) before it is either archived or deleted.
- Establish Secure Communication Channels: Secure protocols (e.g., TLS) should transmit data between edge devices and central systems to protect sensitive data like logs and metrics from unauthorized access. Encrypted channels can also be used to prevent data breaches by safeguarding traces and logs sent to the central observability system

### 2. Define Key Metrics

Once the infrastructure is set up, you need to define which metrics will be monitored at the edge to ensure the system's health and performance.

- System Health Indicators: These metrics give your insight into the overall health of edge devices. This includes CPU and memory usage, disk space, and network availability. Monitoring these metrics helps detect potential issues before they affect system performance. A high CPU usage rate may signal that a device is overloaded and may need additional resources or optimization.
- Application Performance Metrics: For edge applications, you'll want to monitor things like response time, error rates, and throughput. These metrics help you assess how well edge applications are performing under load and if they are meeting user expectations. If an IoT sensor application is reporting unusually high response times, this could indicate that there’s a bottleneck in the data processing pipeline.
- Business-Specific Key Performance Indicator (KPIs): Depending on the use case, edge observability might also include tracking business-specific metrics like transaction volume, user engagement, or uptime for critical services. These KPIs can help ensure that edge systems are delivering value and meeting organizational objectives. For an example, in a retail environment, KPIs could include transaction success rates or customer wait times, which directly impact business performance.

### 3. Set Baselines

Establishing baselines for what is considered "normal" helps to identify anomalies and performance degradation early on.

- Monitor Normal Patterns: By tracking historical data for a period, you can establish baseline patterns for the metrics you've defined. This helps you recognize what typical performance looks like for each edge device, application, or service. To take an example, if you monitor memory usage over the course of a week, you may find that most devices consume 50% of their memory. This gives you a baseline for comparison in case of spikes.
- Establish Alert Thresholds: Once baselines are defined, it’s crucial to set up alerting mechanisms. Alerts should trigger when metric values deviate significantly from the baseline, such as CPU usage consistently exceeding 90%). Setting up thresholds based on normal patterns will help you catch issues early and minimize downtime.
- Define Performance Targets: To ensure optimal performance, it's important to set performance targets that align with your business objectives. These targets can be based on things like:
  - Response Time: The time it takes for a system to respond to a request (e.g., requests should be processed in under 100ms).
  - Uptime: The percentage of time a system is operational and available (e.g., 99.9% availability).
  - Resource Utilization: The amount of system resources, such as CPU or memory, being used (e.g., CPU usage should stay below 75%).
    As an example, in a content delivery system, the target might be that content load times should be under 3 seconds for 95% of users.

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Proactively detect issues before they impact end users to enhance response times and improve user experience.                           | Shift-Left Approach: This involves moving observability practices earlier in the development process, allowing for proactive issue detection rather than relying solely on post-deployment monitoring                                 |
| Reduce unnecessary data collection to save bandwidth and lower processing costs.                                                        | Adaptive sampling: It means selectively collecting data rather than monitoring everything continuously. By analyzing traffic patterns, you can capture data only when certain thresholds are crossed or when unusual activity occurs. |
| Minimize latency and improve issue response times by reducing dependency on central systems.                                            | Local Intelligence: Deploying localized monitoring solutions that can analyze data on-site reduces dependency on central systems and improves response times to issues                                                                |
| Align alerts with the unique and dynamic behaviors of edge environments to ensure accurate, actionable notifications.                   | Real-Time Alerting: Implementing systems that provide immediate alerts upon detecting anomalies ensures that teams can act swiftly to mitigate potential problems before they escalate                                                |
| Ensure data continuity and integrity by safeguarding it during outages, allowing for seamless processing once connectivity is restored. | Establish Failover and Redundancy: In edge environments where network connectivity can be inconsistent, setting up failover mechanisms and local storage redundancy                                                                   |
| Optimize monitoring resource usage to avoid impacting the performance of edge devices.                                                  | Optimize Resources: Choose lightweight monitoring solutions and limit monitoring frequency to minimize impact on edge devices' performance.                                                                                           |
