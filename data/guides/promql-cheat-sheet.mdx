Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) is a powerful tool for extracting insights from Prometheus metrics. Whether you're diagnosing system performance, setting up alerts, or analyzing historical trends, PromQL enables precise data querying and visualization. This comprehensive cheat sheet will guide you from the basics to advanced techniques, with practical examples and tips for performance optimization.

## What is PromQL and Why is it Essential for Monitoring?

PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) is the specialized query language designed for Prometheus, the popular open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. It allows you to select and aggregate time series data in real time, forming the foundation of Prometheus' powerful monitoring capabilities.

Key features that make PromQL indispensable for monitoring include:

1. Time series focus: PromQL is optimized for working with time series data, making it ideal for tracking metrics over time.
2. Flexible data selection: You can easily filter and group metrics based on labels, allowing for precise data retrieval.
3. Built-in functions: PromQL offers a wide range of functions for rate calculations, aggregations, and transformations.
4. Alerting integration: PromQL queries form the basis of Prometheus alerting rules, enabling proactive monitoring.

PromQL fits seamlessly into the Prometheus ecosystem, working hand-in-hand with other components like the Prometheus server, Alertmanager, and various exporters. Mastering PromQL empowers you to extract maximum value from your Prometheus deployment.

## Quick Reference: Essential PromQL Syntax and Operators

PromQL's syntax is straightforward yet powerful, allowing you to retrieve, filter, and aggregate metrics with precision.

This section provides a quick reference to PromQL's fundamental building blocks, including basic syntax, operators, and essential commands you'll use daily.

### Basic Metric Selection and Label Matching

To select metrics in PromQL, use this syntax:

```
metric_name{label="value"}
```

- Select all metrics: `http_requests_total`
- Match specific label: `http_requests_total{status="200"}`
- Multiple label matchers: `http_requests_total{status="200", method="GET"}`

Label matching operators:

- `=`: Exact match
- `!=`: Not equal
- `=~`: Regex match
- `!~`: Regex not match

Example:

```
http_requests_total{status=~"4.."} # Match all 4xx status codes
```

### Arithmetic Operators

PromQL supports basic arithmetic operations between scalar values and time series:

- `+`: Addition
- `-`: Subtraction
- `*`: Multiplication
- `/`: Division
- `%`: Modulo
- `^`: Exponentiation

Example:

```
(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemFree_bytes) / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes * 100
```

### Comparison and Logical Operators

Use these operators for filtering and combining time series:

Comparison:

- `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`

Logical:

- `and`, `or`, `unless`

Example:

```
http_requests_total > 100 and http_errors_total < 5
```

### Time-Based Operators

PromQL allows you to select data over specific time ranges:

- Range vector: `[5m]` (last 5 minutes)
- Offset: `offset 1h` (data from 1 hour ago)

Example:

```
rate(http_requests_total[5m] offset 1h)
```

## Common PromQL Functions Every DevOps Engineer Should Know

PromQL includes a wide range of functions that simplify tasks like rate calculation, data aggregation, and histogram analysis.

### Rate Calculations

1. `rate()`: Calculate per-second average rate of increase
    
    ```
    rate(http_requests_total[5m])
    ```
    
2. `irate()`: Calculate instant rate of increase
    
    ```
    irate(http_requests_total[5m])
    ```
    

### Aggregation Functions

1. `sum()`: Add values
    
    ```
    sum(http_requests_total) by (status)
    ```
    
2. `avg()`: Calculate average
    
    ```
    avg(node_cpu_utilization) by (instance)
    ```
    
3. `max()` and `min()`: Find maximum and minimum values
    
    ```
    max(http_request_duration_seconds) by (endpoint)
    ```
    
4. `increase()`: Calculates the total increase over a time window.
    
    ```
    increase(http_requests_total[5m])
    ```
    

### Histogram Analysis

`histogram_quantile()`: Calculate quantiles from histogram metrics

```
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
```

### Absence Detection

1. `absent()`: Check if a metric is missing
    
    ```
    absent(up{job="important-service"})
    ```
    
2. `absent_over_time()`: Check if a metric was absent for a time range
    
    ```
    absent_over_time(up{job="important-service"}[1h])
    ```
    

## Mastering Time Series Selection in PromQL

Time-series data is the backbone of Prometheus, and selecting the right data is key to gaining actionable insights. PromQL provides various mechanisms—instant vectors, range vectors, offsets, and subqueries—to extract and manipulate time-series data effectively.

### Instant Vector Selectors

Instant vectors allow you to query the current state of a metric at a specific point in time. For example:

```
http_requests_total
```

This retrieves the latest value of `http_requests_total` for all time series with that metric.

### Range Vector Selectors

Range vectors allow you to analyze trends or patterns by selecting data over a specified time window:

```
http_requests_total[5m]
```

This fetches all recorded data points for `http_requests_total` from the last 5 minutes.

### Offset Modifier

The `offset` modifier shifts the time frame of a query, helping you compare past and present metrics:

```
http_requests_total offset 1h
```

This selects the value of `http_requests_total` from 1 hour ago.

### Subquery Syntax

Subqueries let you perform advanced calculations over a range of time. For example:

```
max_over_time(rate(http_requests_total[5m])[1h:])
```

This computes the maximum rate of `http_requests_total` over each 1-hour interval, with 5-minute windows for rate calculation.

## Advanced PromQL Techniques for Performance Optimization

As your infrastructure grows, writing efficient PromQL queries becomes increasingly critical to ensure smooth performance and quick responses. 

Here are some best practices and advanced techniques to optimize your PromQL queries for large-scale deployments and complex monitoring scenarios.

1. Use label matching efficiently:
    - Avoid using `{__name__=~".*"}` which selects all metrics
    - Be specific with label matches to reduce the query scope
2. Leverage pre-recorded rules:
    - Create recording rules for frequently used queries
    - Example rule:
        
        ```yaml
        - record: job:http_requests_total:rate5m
          expr: rate(http_requests_total[5m])
        ```
        
3. Optimize aggregation operations:
    - Aggregate metrics at collection time when possible
    - Use `without` instead of `by` for excluding specific labels
4. Best practices for performant queries:
    - Avoid using `group_left` and `group_right` for large datasets
    - Use time-bounded range vectors (e.g., `[5m]` instead of `[1h]`)
    - Limit the use of regex in label matches

## Real-World PromQL Examples for Common Monitoring Scenarios

PromQL excels in practical applications, enabling engineers to monitor critical metrics like error rates, resource utilization, etc with ease.

### Calculating Error Rates

```
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) * 100
```

This query calculates the percentage of HTTP 5xx errors over total requests.

### Identifying Resource Bottlenecks

CPU usage:

```
100 - (avg by(instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100)

```

Memory usage:

```
(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes) / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes * 100
```

Disk usage:

```
100 - ((node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/"} * 100) / node_filesystem_size_bytes{mountpoint="/"})
```

### Monitoring Application-Specific Metrics

Response time percentiles:

```
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, service))
```

This query calculates the 95th percentile of HTTP request durations across services.

### Alerting on Anomalies

A sudden spike in error rate:

```
increase(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 10 * increase(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m] offset 5m)
```

This alert triggers if the number of errors in the last 5 minutes is 10 times higher than the previous 5-minute period.

## Troubleshooting and Debugging with PromQL

PromQL is a versatile tool for identifying and resolving performance issues in your system. Here's how to make the most of it:

### Identifying Outliers and Spikes

Use PromQL functions like `max_over_time`, `quantile_over_time`, or `stddev_over_time` to detect anomalies:

```sql
stddev_over_time(http_requests_total[5m]) > threshold
# Example: stddev_over_time(http_requests_total[5m]) > 200
```

This helps identify metrics with abnormal behavior, such as spikes or unexpected variance.

### Correlating Metrics Across Services

Correlate metrics from different services to find root causes. For example:

```
rate(service_a_requests_total[1m]) / rate(service_b_requests_total[1m]
```

This can reveal bottlenecks or mismatches in service interactions.

### Debugging Cardinality Issues

To find metrics with high cardinality:

```
topk(10, count by (__name__) ({__name__=~".+"}))
```

This query lists the top 10 metrics with the highest number of time series.

### Handling Missing or Incomplete Data

To fill gaps in data with a default value:

```
http_requests_total or vector(0)
```

This query returns 0 for any missing data points in `http_requests_total`.
