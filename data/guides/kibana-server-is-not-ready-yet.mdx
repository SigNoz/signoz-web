    - Ensure both containers are part of the same Docker network. This ensures they can resolve each other's container names as hostnames and establish proper connectivity.
        
        ```bash
        docker network create elastic-network
        docker run --name elasticsearch --network elastic-network elasticsearch
        docker run --name kibana --network elastic-network kibana
        ```
        
    - Use container names as hostnames in the `kibana.yml` file:
        
        ```yaml
        elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://elasticsearch:9200"]
        ```
        

2. Volume Mounting and Permission Problems

- Symptom: Kibana fails to start due to permission issues when mounting configuration or data volumes.
- Cause: The container’s user may not have the necessary permissions for the mounted host directories.
- Solution:
    - Ensure the directory permissions match the container’s requirements:
        
        ```bash
        sudo chown 1000:1000 /path/to/host/directory
        ```
        
    - Use Docker’s `-user` flag to run the container with specific user permissions:
        
        ```bash
        docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v /path/to/host/directory:/usr/share/kibana kibana
        ```
        

3. Docker Compose Configuration Best Practices

- Symptom: Kibana and Elasticsearch services fail to communicate or start correctly in a Docker Compose setup.

        ```bash
        	docker exec kibana curl -u username:password "http://elasticsearch:9200"
        ```
        
    - Use Docker Compose health checks to ensure services are ready before dependent containers start:
        
        ```yaml
        healthcheck:
          test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://elasticsearch:9200"]
          interval: 30s
          timeout: 10s
          retries: 3
        ```
        

By addressing these Docker-specific challenges, you can optimize Kibana’s deployment in containerized environments, ensuring reliable performance and connectivity.

    - Upgrade Elasticsearch before Kibana to maintain compatibility.

### 4. Optimizing Kibana and Elasticsearch Configurations for Performance

- Purpose: Proper configurations enhance stability and prevent resource-related issues.
- How to Implement:
    - Allocate sufficient heap size for Elasticsearch and Kibana:
        
        ```bash
        export ES_JAVA_OPTS="-Xms2g -Xmx2g"
        export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=2048"
        ```
        
    - Optimize Elasticsearch index settings for large datasets.
    - Regularly audit `kibana.yml` and `elasticsearch.yml` configurations to ensure they meet current workload requirements.

By adopting these measures, you can reduce the risk of encountering "Kibana Server Is Not Ready Yet" errors, ensuring smoother operations and better system reliability.
