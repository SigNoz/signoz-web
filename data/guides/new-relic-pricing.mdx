## Why Pricing Clarity is a Game-Changer for Modern Observability Teams

Observability has become a critical component of software development and operations, especially as systems grow in complexity. Teams need clear, actionable insights into system performance to ensure reliability and efficiency. However, as observability becomes more essential, the costs associated with monitoring these systems can escalate quickly.

Pricing clarity plays a significant role in addressing this challenge. Traditional pricing models often come with hidden costs and rigid structures, making it difficult for teams to manage expenses effectively. Let’s break down the key issues with traditional models and explore how alternative approaches, like usage-based pricing, aim to solve them.

### Challenges with Traditional Pricing Models

Many observability tools, like [Datadog](https://signoz.io/blog/datadog-pricing), still rely on traditional host- or container-based pricing models. While this approach may work in some scenarios, it also introduces several challenges:

- Unpredictable Costs: Rapid scaling can result in sudden budget spikes, making it hard to forecast expenses.
- Rigid Structures: Legacy pricing models don’t always align with modern, dynamic architectures, leading to inefficiencies.
- Opaque Billing: Understanding how costs correlate with actual usage can be challenging, leaving teams in the dark.

### The Shift to Usage-Based Pricing

Usage-based pricing is an alternative approach that focuses on data ingestion and user access rather than the number of hosts or containers. This model has gained traction as a way to address some of the shortcomings of traditional pricing. Here’s how it works and what it offers:

- Scalability: Teams pay for the data they ingest, which can be more cost-effective for dynamic environments.
- Flexibility: Usage-based models allow for dynamic scaling without rigid commitments, adapting to changing infrastructure needs.
- Transparency: By eliminating hidden costs like data egress fees, this approach provides clearer billing and better cost predictability.

However, usage-based pricing isn’t without its challenges. For example, teams need to carefully monitor data ingestion rates to avoid unexpected costs, and it may not always be the most cost-effective option for smaller or less dynamic environments.

### Optimizing Observability Costs

Regardless of the pricing model, optimizing observability costs requires a strategic approach. Here are a few tips:

- Monitor Data Ingestion: Keep a close eye on the volume of data being ingested to avoid unnecessary expenses.
- Leverage Sampling: Use sampling techniques to reduce data volume without compromising on critical insights.
- Evaluate Pricing Models: Assess your infrastructure and usage patterns to determine which pricing model aligns best with your needs.

By understanding the trade-offs between different pricing models and implementing cost-optimization strategies, teams can strike a balance between observability and budget constraints.

## Understanding New Relic's Usage-Based Pricing

### How does New Relic's free tier compare to paid options?

New Relic's free tier offers 100 GB of data ingest and one full platform user, making it suitable for small teams or projects. Paid options provide more data ingest, additional full platform users, and access to advanced features like extended data retention and compliance capabilities

### Can I predict my New Relic costs accurately?

Yes, New Relic's usage-based model allows for more accurate cost predictions. By estimating your monthly data ingest and required user counts, you can closely approximate your costs. New Relic also provides usage dashboards and alerts to help track and manage your spending. However, for large teams with fluctuating workloads, predicting costs can be more challenging.

### What happens if I exceed my data ingestion limit?

If you exceed the 100 GB of free data ingest per month, New Relic will notify you when you’re at 85% of the limit. You’ll need to upgrade to a paid plan to continue data ingestion within the same month. Otherwise, data ingestion will pause until the start of the next month, when your free allowance resets.
