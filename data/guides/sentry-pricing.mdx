To make the most of Sentry, choosing the right pricing plan is key. With options ranging from a free-tier for small projects to enterprise-grade solutions with advanced features, organizations can find a plan that fits their needs and budget. Factors like team size, event volume, and required integrations play a crucial role in selecting the best fit, ensuring efficient monitoring and debugging without overspending.

## Pricing Structure Overview

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/03/sentry.io-pricing-image.webp" alt="Included Monthly Quotas in Paid Plans" caption="Included Monthly Quotas in Paid Plans" />

Sentry's pricing model is influenced by several key factors, each tied to how much data your organization processes. Every plan includes a set quota for different components, and if you exceed those limits, you can pay for additional usage as needed. 

Here’s a breakdown of some key factors that influences the cost:

- **Event Volume**: Sentry's plans come with a standard volume of events for each product or data category. If your application generates more events than the included quota, you can purchase additional capacity either by prepaying for reserved volume or setting up a pay-as-you-go budget.
- **Spans for Performance Monitoring**: Performance monitoring operates on a span-based system, where each transaction consists of multiple spans. Plans come with a quota, and extra spans can be bought as needed.
- **User Seats**: The number of team members with access to your Sentry organization can affect your subscription cost. Different plans offer varying levels of user access, and adding more users may adjust the pricing accordingly.
- **Data Retention**: The duration for which Sentry retains your event data varies by plan. Longer retention periods may be available on higher-tier plans, allowing for extended access to historical data.

Understanding these factors is essential for managing both your organization's monitoring needs and budget effectively.

Here's a breakdown of the pricing structure:
| **Plans** | **Target** | **Price** | **Features** | **Error Monitoring** | **Admin & Compliance** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Developer Plan** | One user | **Free** | • Error Monitoring and Tracing<br/>• Alerts and notifications via email | 5k errors | ISO 27001, HIPAA Security |
| **Team Plan** | Unlimited users | **$26/mo** | • Third-party integrations<br/>• Metric alerts<br/>• Insights (7-day lookback) | 50k errors | ISO 27001, HIPAA Security, SSO: GitHub Organizations |
| **Business Plan** | Multiple teams | **$80/mo** | • Advanced quota management<br/>• Component-specific workflows<br/>• Custom dashboards<br/>• Insights (90-day lookback) | 50k errors | ISO 27001, HIPAA Security, Relay, SSO: GitHub Organizations |

## Usage Caps and Customization

Sentry provides flexible controls to help teams manage their monitoring costs while ensuring they have the necessary resources to track application performance. Without usage caps and customizations, monitoring costs can spiral out of control, especially when an application experiences unexpected spikes in traffic or errors. Teams can **prevent runaway costs, maintain budget predictability, and ensure resources are allocated efficiently**. This allows organizations to **strike a balance between comprehensive monitoring and cost control**, ensuring that critical events are always captured without unnecessary overspending.

### 1. Pay-As-You-Go Budget Controls

In scenarios where your application's activity surpasses the reserved or included quotas unexpectedly, Sentry's Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) model ensures uninterrupted monitoring. By setting a PAYG budget, you can manage additional usage without service disruption, paying only for the extra data processed. This model offers flexibility to handle unforeseen spikes while allowing you to set spending limits to maintain budget control.

Use <a href="https://sentry.io/pricing/#calculator" target="_blank">Sentry's price calculator</a> to estimate costs based on your Pay-As-You-Go usage.

### 2. Reserved Volume and Discounts

For organizations anticipating consistent usage beyond their plan's included quotas, Sentry offers the option to pre-purchase additional capacity at discounted rates. This approach provides cost predictability and savings compared to on-demand rates. It's important to note that any unused reserved volume expires at the end of each billing month, so accurate forecasting of your needs is essential

Note: This pricing only applies to free plans or paid plans **started on June 11th, 2024, or later**.

### 3. Event Filtering

Sentry provides mechanisms to control which events are sent to their servers, allowing developers to filter out unwanted data and manage their event ingestion. This is primarily achieved through the `before_send` callback function in various SDKs. This function allows developers to inspect and modify events before they're sent or discard them entirely by returning `null`. By implementing these controls, teams can effectively manage which events are ingested, helping to prevent unnecessary data from being sent and potentially reducing monitoring costs.

### 4. Spike Protection

 Sentry's **Spike Protection** is a feature designed to help organizations manage unexpected surges in event volume, preventing sudden overages and maintaining cost control. It works by dynamically analyzing your project's typical event patterns and setting thresholds that, when exceeded, temporarily halt the ingestion of excessive events. This ensures that unforeseen spikes, such as those caused by a sudden influx of errors, don't lead to unexpected charges or exhaust your event quota prematurely. Once the spike subsides and event rates return to normal, Spike Protection automatically reactivates event ingestion. This proactive approach allows teams to maintain uninterrupted monitoring while safeguarding against unplanned expenses.
