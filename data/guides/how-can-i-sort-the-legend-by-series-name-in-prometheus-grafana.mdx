In the world of data analysis, getting quick, clear insights is key. When your graphs are cluttered with disorganized legends, spotting trends or comparing time series becomes a headache. This guide will walk you through sorting legends in Prometheus and Grafana, improving your data visualization workflow. We’ll cover everything from built-in options to advanced PromQL techniques.

## Understanding Legends in Prometheus and Grafana

Legends in data visualization serve as keys to interpreting the information displayed in graphs or charts. In the context of Prometheus and Grafana, legends are essential for decoding time series data. They provide context to the plotted lines, helping you distinguish between different metrics or dimensions of your data.

Prometheus generates legends based on the metric names and labels associated with the data it collects. When visualized in Grafana, these legends become critical for interpreting complex, multi-dimensional datasets. A well-organized legend can significantly enhance your ability to analyze trends, spot anomalies, and draw insights from your time series data.

Having understood legends, next thing which comes into mind is `series name`. 

### What is `Series Name` ?

In the context of Prometheus and Grafana, a series name refers to the unique identifier for a specific set of time series data. 

It typically includes the metric name and a combination of its associated labels. Here's a breakdown:

Components of a Series Name

1. Metric Name: This is the primary identifier for the metric being tracked. For example, `http_requests_total` is a metric name that counts the total number of HTTP requests.
2. Labels: Labels are key-value pairs that provide additional context for the metric. They help differentiate between different instances of the same metric.
    
    For instance, a series might look like:
    
    ```lua
    http_requests_total{method="GET", status="200"}
    ```
    
    In this example:
    
    - `http_requests_total` is the metric name
    - `method="GET"` and `status="200"` are labels

Example

If you have multiple labels for HTTP requests, the series names could look like:

- `http_requests_total{method="GET", status="200"}`
- `http_requests_total{method="POST", status="404"}`
- `http_requests_total{method="GET", status="500"}`

Each of these series represents a different combination of labels for the same metric, allowing you to analyze performance, error rates, and other dimensions of your application’s behavior.

### Importance of Series Names

- Data Organization: Series names help organize and categorize your data in Grafana.
- Visualization: They are used in legends to help users identify which data series is represented in visualizations.
- Filtering and Querying: You can filter and aggregate data based on series names and labels in Prometheus queries.

## Why Sorting Legends is Crucial for Data Analysis

The ability to sort legends by series name is more than just a cosmetic preference — it's a powerful tool for effective data analysis. Here's why it matters:

1. Improved readability: Sorted legends make it easier to locate specific series, especially in graphs with numerous metrics.
2. Easier comparison: When series are sorted, comparing related metrics that might be alphabetically adjacent becomes simpler.
3. Pattern recognition: Sorted legends can reveal patterns or groupings in your data that might not be immediately apparent otherwise.
4. Time-saving: For analysts and developers working with large datasets, sorted legends can significantly reduce the time spent searching for specific metrics.
5. Multi-dimensional data: When dealing with high-cardinality data or multiple dimensions, sorting becomes more complex and can impact performance.

## Methods to Sort Legends by Series Name in Grafana

There are several methods to sort legends by series name in Grafana:

### 1. Using Grafana's Built-in Sorting Options

Grafana 7 and later versions offer built-in options for legend sorting:

1. In the Grafana Dashboard go to `Dashboards` section and select the dashboard for which you want to edit the panel. 
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/how-can-i-sort-the-legend-by-series-name-in-prometheus-grafana-image%201.webp" alt="Selecting dashboards in Grafana" caption="Selecting dashboards in Grafana" />
    
2. Select the panel you want to work with within the dashboard and click the `Edit` option.

### 2. Leveraging Prometheus Query Functions

While Prometheus doesn't have direct sorting functions, you can use label manipulation to influence legend order. 

To use `sort_by_label()` or `sort_by_label_desc()`, you must enable the experimental feature in Prometheus by passing the feature flag:

```bash
--enable-feature=promql-experimental-function
```

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/how-can-i-sort-the-legend-by-series-name-in-prometheus-grafana-image%207.webp" alt="Enabling experimental feature on Prometheus" caption="Enabling experimental feature on Prometheus" />

After enabling the flag, you can sort by label values directly. For example:

- Ascending order by label value (`generation` in this case):
    
    ```
    sort_by_label(python_gc_objects_collected_total, "generation")
    ```
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/how-can-i-sort-the-legend-by-series-name-in-prometheus-grafana-c21d717b-09a3-4a6b-8136-bf5b03ad29b0.webp" alt="Running PromQL to sort legends in ascending order" caption="Running PromQL to sort legends in ascending order" />
    
- Descending order by label value (`generation`):
    
    ```
    sort_by_label_desc(python_gc_objects_collected_total, "generation")
    ```
