# 📌 Overview

We’re transitioning our metric naming from always underscore-based (e.g., `system_memory_usage`) to unnormalized (e.g., `system.memory.usage` i.e metric data stored as it arrives) across our cloud observability pipeline. This change aligns with OpenTelemetry semantic conventions, enables us to build seamless correlations.

To facilitate a seamless migration, we’ve initiated a dual write phase where both the normalized and unnormalized metrics are written. During this phase, unnormalized metrics remain in the background—hidden from user views—so you will only see underscore-based metrics (`system_memory_usage`).

## 🔍 Why We Are Migrating

- **Semantic Alignment:** Dot-separated metric names follow the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions, providing clearer structure and hierarchy (e.g., `system.memory.usage`).
- **Cross-Signal Compatibility:** Consistent naming across signal reduces confusion and simplifies correlations.

## 📆 Migration Timeline

### Dual Export Phase (In Progress)

- **Start:** Already underway
- **Duration:** Until next week
- **Behavior:** Both the normalized and unnormalized metrics are written, you won't be able to see any change during this period.

### Final Migration (Next Week)

- We will retire the normalized metrics entirely.
- You will continue to see **only** unnormalized metric names moving forward.

## 📣 Final Rollout

From next week onwards, we will roll out the final migration. You will begin to see unnormalized metric names exclusively; normalized metrics will no longer appear in your views.

## ✅ What You Need to Do

Absolutely **nothing**. The migration is fully managed by our team — your dashboards, alerts, and queries will continue to operate without any changes.
