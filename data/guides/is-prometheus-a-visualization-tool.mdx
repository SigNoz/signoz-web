Prometheus itself is not a visualization tool; it is a powerful monitoring and alerting toolkit. However, it does include basic built-in visualization capabilities, which are intended for ad-hoc exploration and troubleshooting rather than for creating comprehensive dashboards. To create rich, interactive dashboards and gain deeper insights from your metrics, you will typically use a dedicated visualization tool.

## What is Prometheus?

Prometheus excels at collecting metrics from various sources, including applications, and systems. It stores these metrics as time-series data, making it well-suited for tracking trends, identifying anomalies, and generating alerts. 

## Prometheus's Built-In Visualization Tool

Prometheus includes two main visualization components:

- Expression Browser: This simple web interface lets you enter PromQL queries and immediately see the results as graphs or tables. It's great for quick ad-hoc exploration and troubleshooting.
- Console Templates: These are <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/consoles/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">customizable Go templates</a> that allow you to create basic dashboards within Prometheus. They offer more flexibility than the Expression Browser but have a steep learning curve.

### Limitations of Prometheus's Built-In Visualization

- Prometheus visualization is primarily for ad-hoc exploration and debugging.
- It lacks advanced features for creating complex visualizations.

## When to Use Prometheus's Built-In Visualization vs. a Dedicated Visualization Tool

Prometheus's built-in visualization tools are suitable for specific scenarios, while dedicated visualization tools offer more comprehensive capabilities for complex use cases. Here's a breakdown to help you decide which to use:

### When to Use Prometheus's Built-In Visualization

- Quick ad-hoc queries: If you need to quickly inspect metrics and perform simple data exploration, Prometheus's expression browser and basic graphing are sufficient.
- Limited visualization needs: If your monitoring requirements are relatively simple and don't require advanced visualizations or dashboards, Prometheus's built-in capabilities might suffice.

### When to Use a Dedicated Visualization Tool

- Complex dashboards: If you need to create comprehensive dashboards with multiple panels, custom layouts, and interactive elements, a dedicated visualization tool in this area.
- Advanced visualization types: A dedicated visualization tool offers a wide range of visualization options, including heatmaps, histograms, gauges, and more, which are not available in Prometheus.
- Collaboration and sharing: Dedicated visualization tools allow you to easily share dashboards with your team members, and stakeholders, or even embed them in external applications.
- Alerting integration: Dedicated visualization tools integrate seamlessly with Prometheus's alerting system, enabling you to create visually appealing alerts and notifications based on your dashboards.
- Long-term data analysis: If you need to analyze historical trends and patterns in your metrics data over extended periods, dedicated visualization tools provide better tools for this purpose.
- Integrating with other data sources for unified visualization: Dedicated tools can connect to various data sources (databases, logs, cloud services, etc.), allowing you to visualize metrics from Prometheus alongside other relevant data. This gives you a holistic understanding of your systems and applications.
- Simplifying monitoring: Instead of jumping between different tools to monitor various aspects of your infrastructure, a unified visualization allows you to see everything in one place, saving time and effort.

## A Dedicated Visualization and Monitoring Tool - SigNoz

While Prometheus is a powerhouse for collecting and storing metrics data, its built-in UI is primarily functional rather than visually appealing or designed for deep analysis. A good option is to use a dedicated visualization and monitoring tool like SigNoz to analyze your metrics data

SigNoz is an open-source observability platform that provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring applications and infrastructure. It combines metrics monitoring, distributed tracing, and log management into a single, unified platform.

SigNoz provides:

- Intuitive Visualization: SigNoz transforms raw Prometheus metrics into meaningful visualizations through customizable dashboards. You can easily create interactive graphs, charts, and tables to comprehensively understand your system's performance and health.
- Unified Observability: SigNoz goes beyond just visualizing metrics. It brings metrics, traces, and logs together, offering a comprehensive view of your systems.
- Performance and Scalability: SigNoz uses Clockhouse for storage. ClickHouse enables SigNoz to handle large volumes of data and complex queries with ease.
- OpenTelemetry Native: SigNoz is built on OpenTelemetry, an emerging industry standard for instrumentation and observability. This ensures vendor neutrality, flexibility, and seamless integration with a wide range of tools and frameworks.

## Conclusion

Prometheus stands out as a robust monitoring and alerting toolkit, leveraging its strength in metric collection and storage. Prometheus comes with basic visualization capabilities but for comprehensive analysis of metrics data, it is more suitable to use a dedicated visualization tool.

Key Takeaways:

- The Expression Browser and Console Templates within Prometheus are useful for quick checks and basic dashboards.
- For complex dashboards, advanced visualizations, collaboration, long-term data analysis, and integration with other data sources, dedicated visualization tools are necessary.
