Embedding Grafana charts directly into your web applications allows users to access dashboards seamlessly, but securely implementing this can be tricky. Grafana, by default, prompts for login when embedding charts, which disrupts the user experience. This guide will take you through various methods to embed Grafana charts with authentication, covering everything from configuration to securing access. 

## Understanding Grafana Embedding Options

When embedding Grafana charts, each method offers unique benefits and limitations:

- Iframe Embedding: The simplest way to embed Grafana charts in an external site using HTML iframes.
    - Limitations: Requires separate authentication handling, often resulting in login prompts or issues with token-based authentication. Additionally, iframes can expose your dashboard to potential cross-site security risks.
- Panel Plugins: Some Grafana plugins allow embedding without iframes, enhancing security and flexibility.
    - Limitations: Often more complex to set up, requiring additional configuration and possibly specific Grafana or plugin versions to work correctly.
- Direct URL Access: Sharing dashboards via a direct URL provides quick access to Grafana dashboards.
    - Limitations: Lacks the flexibility to control access programmatically, making it less secure for embedding in applications. URL-based access can also expose dashboards if URLs are shared or intercepted.

### Security Considerations for Embedded Dashboards

Embedding Grafana charts securely requires strict access controls and strong authentication measures. Use HTTPS to protect data in transit, implement role-based access controls to limit viewer permissions, and consider token management for secure embedding.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Authenticated Iframe Implementation

Below are the steps to securely configure and embed Grafana charts in iframes, allowing for authentication without disrupting the user experience.

### Setting Up Grafana Configuration

1. Enable Anonymous Access (optional):
    
    In `grafana.ini`, you can enable anonymous access to public dashboards. 
    
    ```toml
    [auth.anonymous]
    enabled = true
    org_name = Main Org.
    org_role = Viewer
    ```
    
    However, for secure implementations, it's best to skip this step to prevent unrestricted access.
    
2. Configure CORS Settings:
    
    Ensure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is enabled in `grafana.ini`:
    
    ```toml
    [server]
    allow_embedding = true
    [auth.anonymous]
    enabled = true
    allowed_origins = <https://yourapp.com>
    ```
    
3. Set Up Service Account Tokens: 
    
    Grafana supports service account tokens instead of traditional API keys. These tokens allow programmatic access to Grafana while enhancing security and supporting finer-grained permissions.
    
    Here are the detailed steps for generating a service account token:
    
    - Login to Grafana as an admin.
    - Go to Administration → Users and access → Service accounts, and click on the `Add service account` button.
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/embedding-a-website-in-a-grafana-dashboard-image%208.webp" alt="Adding service account in Grafana" caption="Adding service account in Grafana" />
        
    - Add the display name for the service account, choose the corresponding role, and click on the `Create` button.

    - Next, click on the `Add Service account token`
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/embedding-a-website-in-a-grafana-dashboard-image%2010.webp" alt="Add service account token" caption="Add service account token" />
        
    - Generate a token, you can also set an expiration date if you want. The token will be used for access.

    - Copy and securely store the token for use in authenticated requests.
4. Manage Authentication Domains:
Ensure that only trusted domains can embed these dashboards. This helps protect against unauthorized access from unintended sites.
    
    You can specify which domains are allowed to embed Grafana dashboards in `grafana.ini`. For example:
    
    ```toml
    [server]
    allow_embedding = true
    # Only allow specific domains to embed dashboards
    # Example: allow embedding from "https://yourtrusteddomain.com"
    # Use a comma to separate multiple domains
    allow_embedding_from = domain1.com, domain2.com
    ```
    

### Implementing Authentication Methods

Grafana supports several secure authentication methods for embedded dashboards. Here are some of the most effective options:

1. JWT Token Authentication
    - Overview: This method allows you to generate JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for users in your application, which Grafana will accept for authentication.
    - Steps:
        - In your application, create a function to generate a JWT token that encodes user information (like user ID, roles, etc.).
        - Include a secret key for signing the token, ensuring it is kept secure.
            
            ```python
            import jwt
            from datetime import datetime, timedelta
            
            def create_jwt(user_id):
                payload = {
                    'sub': user_id,
                    'exp': datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=30)  # Token expiration time
                }
                return jwt.encode(payload, 'your_secret_key', algorithm='HS256')
            ```
            
        - Configure Grafana to accept JWTs by adding an authentication provider in the `grafana.ini` file.
            
            ```toml
            [auth.jwt]
            enabled = true
            # HTTP header to look into to get a JWT token.
            header_name = X-JWT-Assertion
            ```
            
        - Pass the JWT token as part of the iframe's URL or in the HTTP headers when making requests to Grafana.
            
            ```python
            def embed_with_jwt(user_id):
                # Generate the JWT token for the given user_id
                token = create_jwt(user_id)
                
                # Create an HTML page with the iframe
                html_content = f"""

                <body>
                    <iframe src="https://<grafana-server>/d/<dashboard-id>?orgId=1&auth_token={token}"></iframe>
                </body>
                </html>
                """
                return render_template_string(html_content) 
            ```

2. OAuth2 Implementation
    - Overview: OAuth2 allows users to authenticate through third-party providers such as Google or GitHub, providing a secure way to access Grafana dashboards without exposing credentials.
    - Steps:
        - Configure OAuth2 in the `grafana.ini` file to define your OAuth settings.
            
            ```toml
            [auth.google] # provider name is replacable e.g., google, github 
            enabled = true
            client_id = <your_client_id>
            client_secret = <your_client_secret>
            scopes = <comma_separated_scopes>
            redirect_uri = http://yourapp.com/oauth2/callback
            ```
            
        - Set up the redirect URI in the OAuth provider’s settings to ensure the provider can redirect users back to your application after authentication.
        - In your application, implement a login flow where users are redirected to the OAuth provider for authentication, and then handle the callback to retrieve the access token.
        - Use the access token to authenticate API requests to Grafana, ensuring your application can access protected resources.

3. Service Account Token Authentication
    - Overview: Service account tokens allow programmatic access to Grafana using tokens that are securely generated and managed, typically for backend applications or scripts.
    - Steps:
        - Generate a service account token in your application that can be used to authenticate with Grafana.
        - In your Grafana configuration (`grafana.ini`), enable the use of service account tokens.
            
            ```toml
            [auth.service_account]
            enabled = true
            ```
            
        - Include the service account token in the iframe’s URL when embedding the Grafana dashboard.
            
            ```python
            def embed_with_service_account():
                token = generate_service_account_token()
                html_content = f"""
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html lang="en">
                <head>
                    <title>Embed Grafana Chart</title>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <iframe src="https://grafana.example.com/d/dashboard-id?orgId=1&access_token={token}"></iframe>
                </body>
                </html>
                """
                return render_template_string(html_content)
            ```
            
    - Note: Service account tokens are ideal for dashboards that don’t require granular user-specific access control but need secure, automated access.
4. Session-Based Authentication
    - Overview: Session-based authentication uses cookies stored in the user's browser to manage user sessions, allowing seamless access to Grafana dashboards for logged-in users.
    - Steps:
        - Ensure your application sets up user sessions upon successful login, managing session cookies correctly.
            
            ```python
            from flask import session
            
            def login_user(user):
                session['user_id'] = user.id  # Save user ID in session
                # Set any other session parameters as needed
            ```
            
        - In your Grafana configuration (`grafana.ini`), ensure that session authentication is enabled.
            
            ```toml
            [auth.session]
            enabled = true
            cookie_samesite = None  # Needed if embedding cross-domain
            ```
            
        - When embedding the Grafana dashboard, ensure that the session cookie is sent along with requests to Grafana. This typically happens automatically if the iframe is served from the same domain or subdomain.

## Security Best Practices

Embedding Grafana charts requires careful attention to security:

1. Implementing Rate Limiting

- Control the number of requests users can make to the Grafana API to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
- Use tools like Nginx to set limits based on user identity or IP address, ensuring that excessive requests are throttled.

2. Using Secure Communication Protocols

- Ensure that all data transmitted between your application and Grafana is encrypted to protect sensitive information.
- Use HTTPS for all requests. Obtain and configure a valid SSL certificate in your Grafana setup.

3. Managing Service Account Token Rotation

- Regularly update service account tokens to minimize security risks associated with token exposure.
- Establish a token management policy that includes generating new tokens, updating application configurations, and revoking old tokens promptly.

4. Implementing Access Controls

- Define user permissions to restrict access to sensitive data and dashboards.
- Utilize Grafana’s role-based access control (RBAC) features to assign appropriate permissions based on user roles.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Here’s how to resolve common problems with embedded Grafana charts:

- CORS Errors: Double-check `grafana.ini` settings, ensuring `allow_embedding` is true and proper origins are allowed.
- Authentication Loops: If Grafana repeatedly prompts for login, verify token or session validity, and make sure tokens aren’t expiring prematurely.
    
    Example code to check token validity and expiration:
    
    ```python
    def is_token_valid(token):
        try:
            payload = jwt.decode(token, 'your_secret_key', algorithms=['HS256'])
            return payload['exp'] > datetime.utcnow()
        except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
            return False  # Token has expired
        except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
            return False  # Token is invalid
    ```
    
- Iframe Rendering Issues: Some browsers restrict iframes from accessing cross-origin content; check browser settings or consider using a reverse proxy.
    
    Example: Use a reverse proxy like Nginx to handle cross-origin requests.
    
    ```
    server {
        listen 80;
    
        location /grafana/ {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;  # Assuming Grafana runs on port 3000
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
    ```
    
- Token Validation Problems: Ensure tokens are correctly signed and within expiration limits. Test token flows thoroughly in development.
    
    Example: Ensure proper signing and testing of tokens.
    
    ```python
    def create_and_validate_jwt(user_id):
    	token = create_jwt(user_id)
    	try:
    		payload = jwt.decode(token, 'your_secret_key', algorithms=['HS256'])
    		print("Token valid:", payload)
    	except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
    		print("Token expired.")
    	except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
    		print("Invalid token.")
    ```
