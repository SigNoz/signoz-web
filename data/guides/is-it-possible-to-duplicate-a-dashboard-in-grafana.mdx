Grafana dashboards are powerful tools for visualizing and analyzing data. As your monitoring needs grow, you might want to create variations of existing dashboards or use them as templates for new projects. This is where dashboard duplication comes in handy, but is it possible to duplicate a dashboard in Grafana? The answer is a resounding yes. Grafana provides built-in functionality to duplicate dashboards, saving you time and effort in recreating complex visualizations from scratch. In this article, we’ll walk through the steps to duplicate dashboards in Grafana and explore ways to customize them for different monitoring needs.

## What is Dashboard Duplication in Grafana?

Dashboard duplication in Grafana refers to the process of creating a replica or an identical copy of an existing dashboard. This feature is built into Grafana's dashboard management system and allows users to quickly generate a copy of a dashboard without having to manually recreate it from scratch. The duplicated dashboard retains all the panels, queries, and visualizations of the original, enabling users to make adjustments without affecting the original configuration.

### Importance of Duplicating Dashboards for Efficiency and Experimentation

Duplicating dashboards is a valuable practice in Grafana because it enhances efficiency and flexibility. Instead of building a new dashboard each time you want to track similar metrics, you can duplicate an existing one and make only the necessary changes. This saves time and reduces the risk of errors. Dashboard duplication is also useful for experimentation; you can test new data sources, queries, or layouts without worrying about breaking the original dashboard. By working on a duplicate, you ensure the integrity of your monitoring setup while still having room to innovate.

### Common Use Cases for Dashboard Duplication

There are several scenarios where duplicating dashboards proves beneficial:

- Creating Dashboards for Different Teams or Projects: When multiple teams need similar monitoring views but with slight variations, dashboard duplication allows for the easy creation of tailored dashboards for each team or project.
- Experimenting with New Features or Layouts: If you're looking to try out new visualizations or adjust the layout of your dashboards, duplicating the original first allows you to experiment safely without disrupting ongoing monitoring.
- Using Dashboards as Templates: Once you've designed a successful dashboard, you can duplicate it to use as a template for future setups, making it easier to maintain consistency across multiple monitoring environments.

Grafana offers a range of dashboard management features, with duplication being a key component. Other features include version control, folder organization, and sharing options, which together create a flexible environment for users to manage and collaborate on dashboards. With the duplication feature, Grafana ensures that users can efficiently manage their monitoring setups, making adjustments and improvements without starting from scratch each time.

## Is it Possible to Duplicate a Dashboard in Grafana?

Yes, Grafana provides a built-in feature that allows users to duplicate dashboards easily. This feature is available in both Grafana Cloud and self-hosted versions, making it accessible to all users, regardless of how they choose to deploy Grafana.

### How Duplication Differs from Creating a New Dashboard

While you can always create a new dashboard from scratch, duplication offers several advantages. When you duplicate a dashboard, you:

- Preserve All Panel Configurations: The duplication process keeps all the original panel settings, including data queries, visualizations, and custom settings, intact. You won’t need to reconfigure queries or adjust visualizations manually, saving valuable time.
- Maintain the Layout and Design: The layout, structure, and design of the original dashboard are fully retained, meaning that all panels and their respective positions will be identical in the duplicate. This consistency allows you to easily build on existing dashboards without having to recreate the design.
- Start with a Functional Dashboard: Unlike creating a new dashboard from scratch, which gives you a blank canvas, duplicating a dashboard provides you with a fully functional setup right away. This is especially useful if you need a similar monitoring view with slight adjustments or want to use the dashboard for a different project or team.

### Duplication Availability in Grafana Cloud and Self-Hosted Versions

Dashboard duplication is a core feature available across both Grafana Cloud and self-hosted instances of Grafana, ensuring that all users can benefit from this time-saving functionality, regardless of how they manage their Grafana deployment.

### Benefits of Using the Duplication Feature Over Manual Recreation

The duplication feature offers several clear benefits over manually recreating dashboards:

- Time Savings: Manually rebuilding a dashboard, especially a complex one with numerous panels and data sources, can be time-consuming. Duplication eliminates this need, allowing you to quickly create copies and make minor changes.
- Error Reduction: When duplicating, you reduce the risk of introducing errors during the manual setup of panels or queries. Since the duplicated dashboard inherits the exact settings and structure, you ensure accuracy and consistency across different dashboards.
- Experimentation Without Risk: Duplication allows you to experiment freely with new ideas, layouts, or data sources. If something doesn’t work as expected, you can always return to the original dashboard without losing any of the changes you made in the duplicate.

    3. Finding the Dashboard UID: 
    Open the dashboard you want to duplicate. Look at the URL in your browser. The UID is the last part of the URL. For example, in `http://your-grafana-url/d/be2evm5oplddsf/dashboard-name`, the UID is `be2evm5oplddsf`.
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/11/is-it-possible-to-duplicate-a-dashboard-in-grafana-Screenshot_2024-10-30_at_3.35.18_PM.webp" alt="Grafana’s Dashboard" caption="Grafana’s Dashboard" />
        
    4. Prepare the Python Script: 
    Create a new Python file (e.g., `duplicate.py`) and copy the following code into it. Also Make sure you have the `requests` library installed. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using pip
        
        ```
        pip install requests
        ```
        
        Copy the following code and paste the below into the `duplicate.py` file
        
        ```python
        import requests
        
        def duplicate_dashboard(service_account_token, dashboard_uid, new_title):
            headers = {
                "Authorization": f"Bearer {service_account_token}",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            }
        
            # Get original dashboard by UID
            response = requests.get(f"http://127.0.0.1:62141/api/dashboards/uid/{dashboard_uid}", headers=headers)
            
            if response.status_code == 200:
                dashboard = response.json().get("dashboard")
                
                if not dashboard:
                    return {"error": "Dashboard not found in response"}
        
                # Modify dashboard title and clear IDs to make it a new dashboard
                dashboard["title"] = new_title
                dashboard["id"] = None  # Remove the original ID
                dashboard.pop("uid", None)  # Remove the UID for new dashboard creation
        
                # Create the new dashboard
                payload = {"dashboard": dashboard, "overwrite": False}
                response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:62141/api/dashboards/db", headers=headers, json=payload)
        
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    return response.json()
                else:
                    return {"error": "Failed to create the new dashboard", "details": response.json()}
            else:
                return {"error": "Failed to fetch the dashboard", "details": response.json()}
        
        # Replace the following values with your actual data
        service_account_token = "<your-service-account-token>"
        dashboard_uid = "<your-dashboard-uid>"
        new_title = "Duplicated Dashboard Title"
        
        result = duplicate_dashboard(service_account_token, dashboard_uid, new_title)
        print(result)
        ```
        
        The above script duplicates an existing Grafana dashboard by fetching its data via API, modifying its title, and creating a new copy with the modified details without overwriting the original.
        
        - Replace `YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` with the token you generated.
        - Replace `YOUR_DASHBOARD_UID` with the UID of the dashboard you want to duplicate.
        - Set the `new_title` to the desired name for the duplicated dashboard
    
    e. Run the Script: 
    
    Once you have updated the script with your values, run it from your terminal:
    
    ```
    python duplicate.py
    ```
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/11/is-it-possible-to-duplicate-a-dashboard-in-grafana-Screenshot_2024-10-23_at_11.23.38_PM.webp" alt="Running the code locally" caption="Running the code locally" />

    You can download the dashboard file or you can paste it where its needed. If needed you can store it on git repositories too
    
3. Use Grafana's templating feature to create dynamic, reusable dashboards: 
Grafana's templating feature enables the creation of dynamic dashboards that adapt to user input. By defining template variables, you can create reusable dashboards that allow users to filter data, switch between different data sources, and adjust visualization parameters seamlessly. This enhances flexibility and efficiency, making dashboards more interactive and tailored to specific needs.
4. Develop a naming convention for duplicated dashboards to maintain consistency: 
Establishing a clear naming convention for duplicated dashboards is essential for maintaining organization and clarity within your Grafana environment. Consistent naming helps team members easily identify and differentiate between various dashboard versions. 
For example, you could include the original dashboard name, the date of duplication, and a version number in the title (e.g., "Sales Overview - Copy - 2024-10-21 - v1"). This practice minimizes confusion and streamlines navigation.

## Troubleshooting Common Duplication Issues

Even with Grafana's user-friendly interface, you might encounter some issues when duplicating dashboards:

- Permission errors: 
One of the most common issues when attempting to duplicate a dashboard is a lack of permissions. In Grafana, users are often assigned roles with varying levels of access. If you encounter permission-related errors, ensure that your user account has the required rights to create and modify dashboards. You may need to contact an administrator to grant additional permissions if necessary.
- Data source conflicts: 
After duplicating a dashboard, you might notice that some panels aren’t displaying data correctly. This issue is often related to data source conflicts. When duplicating, Grafana retains the original dashboard’s data sources. However, if the duplicated dashboard is moved to another environment or project, these data sources might not be available or may have different configurations. Always verify that the data sources for the new dashboard are correctly set up and accessible.
- Performance issues: 
Large or complex dashboards, especially those with multiple panels, data sources, and queries, might take a longer time to duplicate. In some cases, you may notice slow performance during the duplication process. Be patient and wait for the duplication to complete, especially in cloud environments where network latency may also contribute to delays. For better performance, consider simplifying dashboards by removing unused panels or optimizing queries.
- Plugin compatibility: 
Grafana allows the use of plugins to extend dashboard functionalities, such as adding custom panels or data visualizations. When duplicating a dashboard, if certain plugins are missing from the new instance of Grafana, some parts of the dashboard may not function as expected. To avoid this issue, verify that all required plugins are installed and enabled in your Grafana instance. If the duplicated dashboard relies on specific plugins, ensure that they are compatible with your Grafana version.
