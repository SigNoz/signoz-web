- Extensibility: Pino supports various plugins and integrations, allowing developers to extend its functionality to meet specific logging needs.
- Custom Serializers: Pino allows the use of custom serializers to transform log data, enabling the redaction of sensitive information or formatting of complex data structures.
- Multiple Log Levels: Pino supports various log levels (fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace), providing granular control over log verbosity.
- Asynchronous Logging: Pino can offload logging operations to a separate process, reducing the impact on the main application thread and improving performance.
- Child Loggers: Child loggers inherit the configuration of the parent logger but can add additional context, useful for logging within specific modules or components.
- Pretty Printing: Pino offers pretty printing of logs for development purposes, making them human-readable and easier to debug.

## Installing and Setting Up Pino

Before moving forward with the implementation, let's start with installing Pino and setting it up in a Node.js application. First, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from <a href="https://nodejs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Node.js official website</a>.

To install Pino, you can use npm

```bash
npm install pino --save
```

  alt="Installing Pino via npm"
  caption="Installing Pino via npm"
/>

Installing Pino via npm

### Basic Setup

Let us learn how to set up a basic Pino Logger, which involves creating and using a logger instance to log messages. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
const pino = require('pino')
const logger = pino()

logger.info('This is an info message')
logger.error('This is an error message')
```

This code initializes Pino and logs an info and an error message. By default, the logs are output to the console in JSON format.

Output:

```jsx
{"level":30,"time":1688510400000,"pid":12345,"hostname":"Anubhavs-MacBook-Air.local","msg":"This is an info message"}
{"level":50,"time":1688510401000,"pid":12345,"hostname":"Anubhavs-MacBook-Air.local","msg":"This is an error message"}
```

## Configuring Pino Logger

Pino offers various configuration options to tailor the logging behaviour to your needs. Two key configurations include setting log levels and defining custom serializers.

### Level Configuration

Pino Logger supports different log levels to control the verbosity of logs. Log levels are essential for filtering the logs based on their importance and severity. Pino’s log levels, in order of severity from highest to lowest, are:

- fatal: Logs critical issues that cause the application to crash.
- error: Logs errors that require attention but don't crash the application.
- warn: Logs warnings about potential issues that might need investigation.
- info: Logs general information about the application's operation.
- debug: Logs detailed debugging information for troubleshooting.
- trace: Logs highly detailed information, typically used for tracing code execution.

You can set the log level when creating the logger instance to filter logs accordingly:

```jsx
const logger = pino({ level: 'debug' })

logger.debug('This is a debug message')
logger.info('This is an info message')
```

In this example, the logger is configured to log messages at the `debug` level and above, meaning it will log `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal` messages.

If you try to log a message below the level with which the logger is initialized, that message will not be logged. For instance, if the logger is set to `info` level:

```jsx
const logger = pino({ level: 'info' })

logger.debug('This debug message will not be logged')
logger.info('This info message will be logged')
```

In this case, the `debug` message will not appear in the logs because the logger is set to only log messages at `info` level and above (i.e., `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`).

Pino also supports dynamic changes to the log level at runtime. This feature is particularly useful in production environments where you may need to increase or decrease logging verbosity on-the-fly to diagnose issues or reduce log noise without restarting the application.

You can use Pino's level method to change the log level dynamically. Here's an example:

```jsx
// logger.js
import pino from 'pino'

const logger = pino({ level: 'info' })

export default logger
```

```jsx
// app.js
import express from 'express'
import logger from './logger.js'

const app = express()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  logger.info('Info level log - Home route accessed')
  logger.debug('Debug level log - Home route accessed')
  res.send('Hello, World!')
})

// Route to change log level
app.post('/log-level', (req, res) => {
  const newLevel = req.query.level
  if (newLevel && ['fatal', 'error', 'warn', 'info', 'debug', 'trace'].includes(newLevel)) {
    logger.level = newLevel
    res.send(`Log level changed to ${newLevel}`)
  } else {
    res.status(400).send('Invalid log level')
  }
})

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  logger.info(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`)
})
```

### Custom Serializers

Custom serializers allow you to transform log data before it is written to the log output. This feature is handy for redacting sensitive information or formatting complex data structures for better readability and security.

To define a custom serializer, you specify it in the Pino configuration. The serializer is a function that takes an object as an input and returns a transformed version of that object. Here’s an example:

```jsx
const pino = require('pino')

const logger = pino({
  serializers: {
    user: (user) => {
      return {
        id: user.id,
        name: user.name,
        // Redacting sensitive information
        email: user.email ? user.email.replace(/(.{2})(.*)(@.*)/, '$1***$3') : undefined,
      }
    },
  },
})

logger.info({ user: { id: 1, name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' } }, 'User info')
```

Output:

  alt="Custom Serializers in Pino - Output"
  caption="Custom Serializers in Pino - Output"
/>

Custom Serializers in Pino - Output

In this example, the `user` serializer transforms the `user` object to redact the email address, ensuring sensitive information is not exposed in the logs. Custom serializers can be applied to any object you log, making them a powerful tool for maintaining security and readability in your logs.

## Logging HTTP requests with Pino

Pino Logger can be integrated with HTTP servers to automatically log incoming requests and outgoing responses, providing valuable insights into your application's HTTP traffic. This is particularly useful for monitoring, debugging, and analyzing the performance and behaviour of web applications.

### Using Pino HTTP Middleware

You can log HTTP requests and responses using the `pino-http` module, which integrates Pino with HTTP servers like Express. This middleware logs details about each request and response, including HTTP method, URL, status code, and response time.

Step 1: Install the pino-http module

```bash
npm install pino --save
```

Step 2: Integrate pino-http into your application

Here’s an example using Express:

```jsx
const express = require('express')
const pino = require('pino')
const pinoHttp = require('pino-http')

const logger = pino()
const httpLogger = pinoHttp({ logger })

const app = express()

// Use Pino HTTP middleware
app.use(httpLogger)

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!')
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
  logger.info('Server is running on port 3000')
})
```

Output -

```jsx
{"level":30,"time":1720120558325,"pid":18553,"hostname":"Anubhavs-MacBook-Air.local","msg":"Server is running on port 3000"}
```

In this example, the Pino HTTP middleware is added to the Express application using `app.use(httpLogger)`. This ensures that all incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses are logged automatically.

## Advanced Features of Pino

Pino Logger provides several advanced features that can enhance your logging setup and make it more powerful and flexible. Here are some of them-

### Child Loggers

Child loggers are useful when you want to create a logger that inherits the configuration of a parent logger but adds additional context. This is particularly useful for logging within specific modules or components of your application.

For example, you might have a main logger for your application, but you want to add module-specific context for logs generated by different parts of your application:

```jsx
const pino = require('pino')
const logger = pino({ level: 'info' })

const childLogger = logger.child({ module: 'user-service' })

logger.info('This is a log message from the main logger')
childLogger.info('This is a log message from the user service')
```

In this example, the `childLogger` inherits the configuration from the `logger` but adds the `module: 'user-service'` context to each log message it generates. This helps in categorizing and differentiating logs from various parts of your application. It is often helpful in large complex applications where each module might generate numerous log messages. By using child loggers, you can easily identify which module a particular log message came from, making it easier to troubleshoot issues and monitor specific parts of the application.

### Asynchronous Logging

Asynchronous logging helps to offload logging operations to a separate process, reducing the impact on the main application thread and improving performance. This is particularly useful in high-performance applications where logging needs to be done without blocking the main execution flow.

To set up asynchronous logging with Pino using transports, you define where and how the logs are written, which helps offload I/O operations from the main application thread. Transports can write logs to files, send them to remote servers, or integrate with other logging services.

```jsx
const pino = require('pino')
const transport = pino.transport({
  target: 'pino/file',
  options: { destination: './logfile' },
})

const logger = pino(transport)

logger.info('This message will be logged asynchronously')
```

In this example, logs are written asynchronously to a file using the `pino/file` transport. This offloads the I/O operations from the main application thread, enhancing overall performance.

### Pretty Printing

While JSON logs are great for machines, they can be difficult to read for humans. For development and debugging purposes, you can use the `pino-pretty` module to format logs in a more readable way:

First, install the `pino-pretty` module:

`npm install pino-pretty`

Then, integrate `pino-pretty` with Pino:

```jsx
const pino = require('pino')
const pretty = require('pino-pretty')

const logger = pino(pretty())

const complexLog = {
  level: 'info',
  time: new Date(),
  user: {
    id: '12345',
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    roles: ['admin', 'user'],
  },
  request: {
    id: 'abcd-1234-efgh-5678',
    method: 'GET',
    url: '/api/resource',
    headers: {
      'user-agent': 'Mozilla/5.0',
      'accept-language': 'en-US',
    },
    params: {
      id: '7890',
    },
    query: {
      search: 'example',
      page: 1,
      limit: 10,
    },
  },
  response: {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: {
      data: [
        { id: 1, name: 'Resource 1' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Resource 2' },
      ],
      metadata: {
        count: 2,
        total: 2,
      },
    },
  },
}

logger.info(complexLog)
```

Output-

```jsx
[02:21:50.283] INFO (26411):
    user: {
      "id": "12345",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "roles": [
        "admin",
        "user"
      ]
    }
    request: {
      "id": "abcd-1234-efgh-5678",
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "/api/resource",
      "headers": {
        "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0",
        "accept-language": "en-US"
      },
      "params": {
        "id": "7890"
      },
      "query": {
        "search": "example",
        "page": 1,
        "limit": 10
      }
    }
    response: {
      "statusCode": 200,
      "body": {
        "data": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Resource 1"
          },
          {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Resource 2"
          }
        ],
        "metadata": {
          "count": 2,
          "total": 2
        }
      }
    }
```

This setup will format the log output to be more human-readable, making it easier to debug and understand the logs during development. The `pino-pretty` module supports various formatting options, such as color coding and timestamp formatting, to enhance readability further.

## Pino Logger in Node.Js Complete Example

Here's a real-world example demonstrating how to use Pino in a Node.js application to log HTTP requests and responses:

```jsx
const express = require('express')
const pino = require('pino')
const pinoHttp = require('pino-http')
const pretty = require('pino-pretty')

const logger = pino(pretty())

// Initialize Pino HTTP middleware
const httpLogger = pinoHttp({ logger })

const app = express()

// Use Pino HTTP middleware
app.use(httpLogger)

// Sample route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  req.log.info('Home route accessed')
  res.send('Hello, World!')
})

app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id
  req.log.info({ userId }, 'User route accessed')
  res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`)
})

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  req.log.error({ err }, 'Unhandled error')
  res.status(500).send('Something went wrong')
})

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  logger.info(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`)

## Best Practices for Using Pino Logger

- Set Appropriate Log Levels: Use the appropriate log levels (`info`, `warn`, `error`, etc.) to ensure clarity and relevance of logs.
- Avoid Over-Logging: Be mindful of logging too much information, which can impact performance and readability.
- Use Child Loggers: Utilize child loggers for modular applications to maintain context and simplify log management.
- Handle Errors Gracefully: Implement error handling mechanisms to capture and log errors effectively.

## Comparing Pino Logger vs. Regular Logger

When choosing a logging solution for your Node.js application, it's essential to understand the differences between Pino and other regular loggers. Here's a comparison highlighting the key aspects:
