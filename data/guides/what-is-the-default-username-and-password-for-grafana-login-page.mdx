When setting up Grafana for the first time, one of the initial steps is logging into the web interface. If you’re here, you’re probably looking for the default username and password to get started. This guide not only provides those details but also walks you through the first-time login process, troubleshooting common issues, and implementing security best practices. 

## Grafana's Default Username and Password

When you first install Grafana, it comes with preset login credentials:

- Default username: admin
- Default password: admin

These default credentials are set during the initial installation process. While they provide immediate access to your Grafana instance, it's important to change them promptly. Using default credentials poses a significant security risk, as they're widely known and can be exploited by malicious actors.

## How to Access Grafana for the First Time

To log in to Grafana for the first time:

1. Access the Grafana Login Page: Open your web browser and navigate to the IP address or domain name where Grafana is installed. Typically, it will look something like `http://localhost:3000`. You will be redirected to the login page.

2. Enter Default Credentials: Use `admin` for both the username and password fields.

Upon your first successful login, Grafana will prompt you to change the default password. This security measure ensures that you set a unique, strong password for your admin account.

### Changing the Default Password

When the password change prompt appears:

1. Enter a new, strong password in the "New password" field.
2. Re-enter the same password in the "Confirm new password" field.
3. Click "Submit" to save your new credentials

Post a successful login, you will be redirected to the Grafana Home page.

## Common Issues with Grafana Default Login

There are several common issues one might face when logging into Grafana. Here’s a quick rundown of these problems and how to resolve them:

1. Forgotten Password Scenarios:
    - Problem: You’ve forgotten the admin password.
    - Solution:
        - Open the `grafana.ini` configuration file (found in `/etc/grafana/` or `/usr/share/grafana/conf/`).
        - Locate the `[security]` section and update the `admin_password` line with a new password.
        - Save the file and restart the Grafana service with:
            
            ```bash
            sudo systemctl restart grafana-server
            ```
            
2. Incorrectly Entered Credentials:
    - Problem: You’re entering the wrong username or password.
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/08/what-is-the-default-username-and-password-for-grafana-login-page-image%204.webp" alt="Grafana Login Error: Invalid Username or Password" caption="Grafana Login Error: Invalid Username or Password" />
        
    - Solution:
        - Double-check that the username is `admin` and the password is entered correctly.
        - Remember that both fields are case-sensitive.
        - If you’ve changed the password recently and can’t recall it, reset the password using the method above.
3. Browser Cache and Cookies Affecting Login:
    - Problem: Cache or cookies are causing login issues, like being stuck in a login loop.
    - Solution:
        - Clear your browser’s cache and cookies.
        - Try logging in from an incognito or private browsing window.
4. Permissions and Access Control Problems:
    - Problem: You can log in but lack access to certain features or settings.
    - Solution:
        - Verify that your account has the appropriate roles, especially the `Admin` role.
        - Adjust permissions in the `Server Admin > Users` section.
        - If using external authentication (LDAP, OAuth), ensure role mappings are correct.

## Securing Your Grafana Instance

After setting up your initial login, it's crucial to implement additional security measures:

1. Password management: Use a strong, unique password for your Grafana admin account. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely.
2. Multi-factor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA for an extra layer of security. Grafana supports various MFA methods, including Google Authenticator and hardware tokens.
3. User roles and permissions: Set up appropriate user roles and permissions to limit access to sensitive data and functionalities.
4. Regular security audits: Conduct periodic security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in your Grafana setup.

## Troubleshooting Grafana Login Problems

If you encounter persistent login issues with Grafana, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Reset Admin Password via CLI:
    - Solution: Use the Grafana CLI to reset the admin password if you’ve lost access to your account.
    - Command:
        
        ```bash
        grafana-cli admin reset-admin-password your_new_password
        ```
        
    - This will reset the admin password and allow you to regain access.
2. Check Grafana Logs:
    - Solution: Review Grafana’s log files for any error messages or authentication issues.
    - Location: Logs are typically found in `/var/log/grafana/grafana.log` or the directory specified in your configuration file.
3. Verify Configuration Files:
    - Solution: Ensure that your Grafana configuration files are correctly set up, especially if you’re using external authentication methods (like LDAP or OAuth).
    - Action: Double-check the `grafana.ini` file and any related configurations to ensure everything is configured correctly.
4. Seek Support:
    - Solution: If problems persist, don’t hesitate to reach out to Grafana’s support channels or community forums for assistance.

### Why Choose SigNoz Over Grafana?

While Grafana excels at displaying metrics from various sources, it has its limitations—especially when it comes to providing a complete observability stack. SigNoz, on the other hand, goes beyond simple metric visualization by integrating metrics, logs, and traces into a unified platform. Here’s why SigNoz is a better choice:

- Unified Observability: Unlike Grafana, which primarily focuses on metrics, SigNoz offers a complete observability solution. It combines metrics, logs, and traces in a single dashboard, allowing you to monitor your entire stack with ease.
- Built on OpenTelemetry: SigNoz is built on OpenTelemetry, ensuring compatibility with modern observability standards. This makes it easier to instrument your applications and collect detailed data on their performance.
- Advanced Tracing Capabilities: While Grafana provides visualizations, SigNoz gives you the ability to trace the journey of individual requests across your services. This level of insight is crucial for diagnosing complex issues and optimizing performance.
- Integrated Alerts and Troubleshooting: With SigNoz, you can set up real-time alerts for unusual activity or potential issues, much like Grafana. However, SigNoz’s integrated logging and tracing features provide deeper insights for troubleshooting problems, all within the same platform.
