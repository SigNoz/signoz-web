In today's cloud-driven world, monitoring is essential to ensure that apps and infrastructures are secure and cost-effective. Whether you have a simple web app or a complex architecture, you need robust monitoring solutions.

Monitoring your logs can quickly identify potential issues once they occur. By combining log monitoring with thresholds and alerts, you can receive automatic notifications of potential issues, threats, and incidents before they become production issues.

In this article, you'll learn about AWS monitoring and deep dive into Amazon CloudWatch. You will also learn how to enhance your monitoring setup using SigNoz.

## What is AWS Monitoring, and Why is it Critical?

Cloud environments often span multiple regions and leverage a diverse set of services. This often results in changing resource demands for unpredictable traffic spikes. Without proper monitoring, a small performance degradation in one component can quickly affect user experience, security, and costs.

AWS monitoring refers to observing and managing the health and security of resources and applications in the AWS cloud. It includes collecting and analysing metrics, logs, and events generated by AWS services. By responding to these insights, you can ensure your cloud infrastructure operates efficiently.

In AWS, you can monitor your resources and apps in real-time, tracking their performance, health, and usage. This visibility into your cloud infrastructure allows you to:

- Understand how each component interacts with others.
- Optimize resource performance based on actual usage and demand.
- Enhance cloud security by detecting unusual or malicious activities, such as login attempts.
- Track resource usage to optimize allocation and reduce unnecessary expenses.

For example, consider you are managing an e-commerce app on AWS that spans multiple regions. During a flash sale, a traffic surge causes slow load times. With monitoring, you can:

- Track performance metrics of your servers, such as CPU utilization.
- Automate responses, such as provisioning new EC2 instances when CPU utilization exceeds 70%.
- Monitor unusual login attempts by auditing API calls.

### Deep Dive into Amazon CloudWatch

CloudWatch lets you track your resources' performance, health, and usage in real-time. It behaves as a centralized place to store metrics, logs, and events. Some of the core features are:

- Automatically collect and track performance indicators such as memory usage or network traffic.
- Aggregate and analyze logs from various AWS services and apps to help you troubleshoot.
- Set thresholds for your metrics and CloudWatch alarms notify you when a metric exceeds its limit. These alarms can trigger actions to automate responses.
- Create custom metrics to track business-specific indicators and build a dashboard to visualize these metrics in a single view.

CloudWatch seamlessly integrates with other AWS services, such as Lambda or Simple Notification Service (SNS). For example, you can configure a CloudWatch to trigger a Lambda function to scale your servers or to notify your developers using SNS during traffic spikes.

How CloudWatch integrates with other AWS services

Some best practices for effective CloudWatch usage are:

- Use detailed monitoring for critical resources such as EC2 instances or RDS databases. You can collect metrics at a one-minute interval, providing more granular data.
- Set up alarms based on impact and set thresholds that are actionable. For example, set an alarm for an RDS instance that triggers when disk space exceeds 85%. This provides enough time to take action before the system runs out of space.
- Use CloudWatch logs insights to query and analyze logs in real-time. This speeds up troubleshooting for issues such as slow database queries.
- Use CloudWatch dashboards to provide a unified view of your system. This helps you visualize key metrics in one place, such as server health or request latency.
