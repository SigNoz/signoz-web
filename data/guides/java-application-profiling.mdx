Java applications slow down for countless reasons—memory leaks, inefficient algorithms, database bottlenecks, thread contention. The frustrating part? These issues often stay hidden until production traffic hits and users start complaining. Even experienced developers can spend days hunting performance problems without the right approach.

Profiling changes that. Instead of guessing where problems might be, profiling shows exactly what's happening inside your running application. This guide covers the practical aspects of Java profiling: which tools actually work, how to interpret the data without drowning in details, and what fixes make real differences in production.

## What is Java Application Profiling?

Profiling means measuring what your Java application actually does when it runs—not what the code suggests it should do. While debugging fixes broken functionality, profiling fixes working code that's just too slow, uses too much memory, or randomly freezes under load.

### How Profiling Differs from Infrastructure Monitoring and Tracing

**Infrastructure monitoring** tells you the server is using 90% CPU. **Profiling** tells you which Java method is causing it.

**Distributed tracing** shows a request took 5 seconds across services. **Profiling** shows the exact line of code where those 5 seconds were spent.

**APM tools** alert when response times spike. **Profiling** reveals it's because someone added a synchronous remote call inside a loop.

Think of it this way: monitoring and tracing show symptoms at the system level, while profiling diagnoses the root cause at the code level. You need both—monitoring to know when something's wrong, profiling to fix it.

### Common Performance Problems

Most performance issues fall into predictable patterns:

**CPU bottlenecks**: One method taking 80% of processing time, nested loops processing large datasets inefficiently, or algorithms with exponential complexity hiding in seemingly simple code.

**Memory issues**: Objects accumulating faster than garbage collection can handle, static collections growing indefinitely, or heap fragmentation causing long GC pauses.

**Concurrency problems**: Threads waiting on locks, deadlocks between services, or thread pools configured wrong for the actual workload.

**I/O delays**: Database queries without proper indexes, N+1 query problems, or network calls in tight loops.

The key insight: performance bugs are just as critical as functional bugs. They just take longer to manifest and harder to reproduce.

### Why Profiling Matters More Than Ever

Modern applications face unique challenges:
- **Distributed complexity**: One slow method can cascade delays across 20 microservices
- **Cloud costs**: Inefficient code directly translates to higher AWS/GCP bills
- **User expectations**: Response times over 100ms lose customers
- **Scale challenges**: Code that works for 100 users might fail at 10,000

The JVM can't fix bad algorithms or architectural problems. Only profiling reveals where your code actually struggles under real load.

## Essential Java Profiling Tools for 2025

The Java ecosystem has dozens of profiling tools, but most teams use the same handful that actually work. Here's what matters:

### Built-in JVM Tools

These ship with Java and cost nothing. Start here before buying anything else.

**Java Flight Recorder (JFR)**  
Built into the JVM since Java 11. Runs in production with \<2% overhead. Records everything: CPU, memory, threads, I/O.

```bash
# Start recording on running app
java -XX:+FlightRecorder -XX:StartFlightRecording=duration=60s,filename=myapp.jfr MyApplication

# Or attach to running process
jcmd <pid> JFR.start duration=60s filename=recording.jfr
```

JFR shines for production issues because it's always available and barely impacts performance. The catch: interpreting the data takes practice.

**Quick command-line tools**
```bash
jconsole                # GUI for basic monitoring
jmap -histo <pid>       # See what's eating memory RIGHT NOW
jstack <pid>            # Find deadlocks and blocked threads
jcmd <pid> GC.heap_info # Quick heap status without dumps
```

These work anywhere Java runs. No setup needed.

### Open-Source Profilers

**VisualVM**  
Still the easiest way to profile local applications. Connect, click profile, see results. Great for development, struggles with remote production apps.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/java-application-profiling-Analyze_JVM_Memory_using_JVisual_VM___Memory_Leak___Heap__Thread_Dump___Profiling___Java_Techie_6-15_screenshot.webp" alt="Profiling in Visual VM" caption="Profiling in Visual VM" />

Best for: Finding memory leaks during development, CPU hotspot analysis, thread deadlock detection.

**Async Profiler**  
The go-to for production CPU profiling. Creates flame graphs that actually make sense.

```bash
./profiler.sh -e cpu -d 30 -f flamegraph.html <pid>
```

Why it works: samples stack traces using OS-level APIs, avoiding JVM safepoint bias. Translation: more accurate results with less overhead.

**Eclipse MAT**  
When you have a 10GB heap dump and need to find the leak, MAT finds it. Automatically identifies leak suspects and shows exactly what's holding references.

### Commercial Profilers

**JProfiler** and **YourKit** dominate this space. Both excellent, both expensive. They excel at:
- Database query profiling (see actual SQL with timings)
- Memory allocation tracking down to line numbers
- IDE integration that actually works
- Support when things go wrong

Worth it? For teams doing serious performance work, yes. For occasional profiling, stick with free tools.

## Setting Up Your Profiling Environment

**Quick setup for development:**
```bash
# Allow profiler attachment
java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005 YourApp
```

**IDE profilers** work great for local development. IntelliJ's profiler is surprisingly good now. Eclipse integrates with VisualVM. But remember: local profiling rarely matches production behavior.

**Production profiling rules:**
- Always use sampling mode (never instrumentation)
- Start with 5-minute sessions during normal load
- Keep overhead under 3%
- Save profiles immediately—they're huge and fill disks
- Test on staging first (seriously)

## The Four Pillars of Java Application Profiling

### 1. CPU Profiling: Finding Processing Bottlenecks

CPU profiling answers one question: where does the time go? Start here when applications feel slow or CPU stays pegged at 100%.

Common discoveries:
- That innocent-looking regex in a loop processing millions of times
- JSON serialization taking 40% of request time
- Logging statements doing expensive string concatenation even when disabled
- Database drivers spinning on connection pool locks

Real example: An e-commerce site's recommendation engine ate 80% CPU. Profiling showed a sort() called inside nested loops—O(n³) complexity hidden in clean-looking code. Adding a cache dropped CPU to 20%.

#### Reading CPU Profiles

**Flame Graphs** show the whole picture at once. Wide bars = time hogs. Tall stacks = deep call chains.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/java-application-profiling-image.webp" alt="Flame Graph to view CPU consumption for different methods" caption="Flame Graph to view CPU consumption for different methods" />

In this flame graph, `Structure.read()` burns 14,443 µs across 419 calls. That's 34µs per call—not terrible individually, but those calls add up.

**What to look for:**
- Wide bars at any level (time sinks)
- Repeated patterns (inefficient loops)
- Deep stacks under simple operations (overengineering)
- Unexpected methods taking time (surprises = bugs)

#### CPU Profiling Gotchas

**JIT compilation skews results**
The JVM optimizes hot code paths while profiling runs. Early measurements show interpreted code, later ones show optimized code. Solution: warm up the JVM before profiling, or use JFR which accounts for compilation.

```bash
# See what's getting compiled
java -XX:+PrintCompilation MyApp | grep "made not entrant"
```

**Sampling vs. Instrumentation**
- Sampling: Takes snapshots every 10ms. Misses short methods but low overhead.
- Instrumentation: Tracks every call. Accurate but can 10x execution time.

Production = always sampling. Development debugging = instrumentation okay.

#### Fixing CPU Bottlenecks

**Algorithm fixes** usually give the biggest wins:

```java
// Classic N² problem hiding in "clean" code
for (Order order : orders) {
    for (Product product : allProducts) {
        if (order.containsProduct(product.getId())) {
            // Process
        }
    }
}

// After profiling shows this takes 90% CPU:
Map<String, Product> productLookup = products.stream()
    .collect(Collectors.toMap(Product::getId, p -> p));

for (Order order : orders) {
    order.getProductIds().stream()
        .map(productLookup::get)
        .forEach(this::process);
}
```

**Caching** works when profiling shows repeated calculations:
```java
@Cacheable("expensive-calculations")
public Result calculate(String input) {
    // Only runs on cache miss
    return doExpensiveWork(input);
}
```

But beware: caches can become memory leaks. Profile memory after adding caches.

### 2. Memory Profiling: Optimizing Heap Usage

Memory problems manifest as OutOfMemoryErrors, long GC pauses, or gradually degrading performance. Memory profiling finds the cause.

Typical culprits:
- Collections that only grow (forgotten cache eviction)
- Listeners that never unregister (classic GUI leak)
- ThreadLocals in thread pools (threads live forever)
- String intern() abuse (permanent heap pollution)
- Closed-over variables in lambdas (surprise references)

#### Finding Memory Leaks

Java memory leaks happen when objects can't be garbage collected. The classic patterns:

**Static collections without bounds:**
```java
public class MetricsCollector {
    // Keeps every metric forever
    private static final List<Metric> ALL_METRICS = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public static void record(Metric m) {
        ALL_METRICS.add(m);  // Memory leak
    }
}
```

**Forgotten listeners:**
```java
// Component adds listener but never removes
EventBus.register(this);
// When 'this' should die, EventBus still holds reference
```

**ThreadLocal in shared threads:**
```java
private static final ThreadLocal<ExpensiveObject> CACHE = new ThreadLocal<>();
// In thread pool, threads never die = objects never collected
```

#### Memory Profiling in Practice

**Getting heap dumps:**
```bash
# Automatic on OOM (production must-have)
java -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/dumps/ MyApp

# Manual dump of running app
jcmd <pid> GC.heap_dump /tmp/heap.hprof
```

**Reading the signs:**

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/java-application-profiling-8c2f5751-1092-49a3-929e-ca8a64d68cfa.webp" alt="Graph demonstrating memory leak" caption="Graph demonstrating memory leak" />

This sawtooth pattern climbing over time = memory leak. Each GC recovers less memory. Eventually: OOM.

**Eclipse MAT** finds leaks fast:
1. Open heap dump
2. Run Leak Suspects report
3. See biggest objects and what holds them
4. Fix the reference chain

#### Memory Optimization Patterns

**Stop creating garbage:**
```java
// Allocation hotspot: String concatenation in loops
log.debug("Processing item " + item.getId() + " for user " + user.getName());
// Creates multiple temporary strings even if debug disabled

// Better: Lazy evaluation
log.debug("Processing item {} for user {}", item.getId(), user.getName());
// No string creation unless actually logging
```

**Object pooling** (when profiling shows high allocation rates):
```java
public class BufferPool {
    private final Queue<ByteBuffer> pool = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();
    
    public ByteBuffer acquire() {
        ByteBuffer buffer = pool.poll();
        if (buffer == null) {
            buffer = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(BUFFER_SIZE);
        }
        return buffer.clear();
    }
    
    public void release(ByteBuffer buffer) {
        pool.offer(buffer);
    }
}
```

Only pool objects that are:
1. Expensive to create
2. Created frequently
3. Have bounded lifetime

#### Garbage Collection Reality Check

**Pick the right GC:**
```bash
# Most apps: G1GC is fine
java -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 MyApp

# Need <10ms pauses? ZGC (but uses more memory)
java -XX:+UseZGC MyApp

# Batch processing? ParallelGC for throughput
java -XX:+UseParallelGC MyApp
```

**GC tuning truth**: Most GC problems are actually memory leaks or excessive allocation. Fix those first. GC tuning is the last resort, not the first response.

### 3. Thread Profiling: Resolving Concurrency Issues

Thread problems are the worst. The app works fine in dev, then production load hits and everything locks up. Thread profiling shows why.

What goes wrong:
- Synchronized blocks creating bottlenecks
- Deadlocks between services
- Thread pools too small (or too large)
- Race conditions corrupting data

#### Thread Issues That Kill Performance

**Contention** (threads waiting for locks):
```java
// Every thread waits here
public synchronized void updateStats(Stats s) {
    globalStats.merge(s);  // 50ms operation
}

// Better: reduce lock scope
public void updateStats(Stats s) {
    Stats merged = s.calculate();  // Do work outside lock
    synchronized(this) {
        globalStats.quickMerge(merged);  // 1ms under lock
    }
}
```

**Deadlocks** (circular waiting):
```java
// Thread 1: locks A, then B
// Thread 2: locks B, then A
// Result: Both stuck forever

// Fix: Always lock in same order
private static final Object LOCK_A = new Object();
private static final Object LOCK_B = new Object();

// All code must acquire LOCK_A before LOCK_B
```

#### Finding Thread Problems

**Thread dumps** tell the story:
```bash
jstack <pid> | grep -A 10 "BLOCKED\|WAITING"
```

Look for:
- Many threads BLOCKED on same lock = contention
- Threads WAITING forever = likely deadlock
- 500 threads for 10 concurrent users = pool misconfigured

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/java-application-profiling-5db1b7de-3dd6-4e08-b8ca-0f50cc482968.webp" alt="Analyzing threads for BLOCKED or WAITING state." caption="Analyzing threads for BLOCKED or WAITING state." />

VisualVM shows blocked threads in red/yellow. If you see many threads blocked on the same monitor, you found your bottleneck.

**Thread pool sizing**:
```java
// CPU-bound work: threads = CPU cores
int threads = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();

// I/O-bound work: threads = cores * (1 + wait/compute)
// If threads wait 50ms and compute 10ms:
int threads = cores * (1 + 50/10);  // cores * 6
```

### 4. I/O Profiling: Optimizing External Operations

I/O is usually the real performance killer. Your code runs in microseconds, then waits milliseconds (or seconds) for the database.

Common I/O disasters:
- N+1 queries (load user, then load each order separately)
- Missing database indexes
- Synchronous HTTP calls in loops
- Reading huge files into memory

#### Database Performance

**Finding slow queries:**
```java
// Use P6Spy or datasource-proxy for automatic SQL logging
@Bean
public DataSource dataSource() {
    return ProxyDataSourceBuilder.create(originalDataSource)
        .logQueryBySlf4j(SLF4JLogLevel.INFO)
        .multiline()
        .build();
}
// Logs: "Query took 523ms: SELECT * FROM orders WHERE..."
```

**Connection pool health:**
```java
// HikariCP exposes key metrics
HikariPoolMXBean poolMXBean = pool.getHikariPoolMXBean();
int active = poolMXBean.getActiveConnections();
int waiting = poolMXBean.getThreadsAwaitingConnection();

if (waiting > 0) {
    log.warn("Threads waiting for connections: {}", waiting);
    // Pool too small or queries too slow
}
```

**The N+1 query trap:**
```java
// Terrible: 1 + N queries
List<Order> orders = loadOrders();
for (Order order : orders) {
    order.setCustomer(loadCustomer(order.getCustomerId()));
}

// Better: 2 queries total
List<Order> orders = loadOrdersWithCustomers();  // JOIN
```

#### Network and File I/O

**HTTP client mistakes:**
```java
// Wrong: Creating new client per request
for (String url : urls) {
    HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();  // Expensive!
    client.send(...);
}

// Right: Reuse client with proper timeouts
private static final HttpClient CLIENT = HttpClient.newBuilder()
    .connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
    .executor(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10))
    .build();
```

**File I/O traps:**
```java
// Memory bomb:
List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(huge10GBFile);

// Stream instead:
Files.lines(huge10GBFile)
    .filter(line -> line.contains("ERROR"))
    .forEach(this::processError);
```

**Batch operations:**
```java
// Instead of 1000 individual inserts:
List<String> batch = new ArrayList<>();
for (Record r : records) {
    batch.add(r.toSql());
    if (batch.size() >= 1000) {
        executeBatch(batch);
        batch.clear();
    }
}
```

## Modern Profiling for Cloud-Native Applications

### Microservices and Containers

Profiling distributed systems is hard. A slow endpoint might involve 10 services. Traditional profilers only see one service at a time.

**Distributed tracing** connects the dots:
```java
// Add trace IDs to track requests across services
@GetMapping("/order/{id}")
public Order getOrder(@PathVariable String id) {
    // Trace ID flows to all downstream calls
    return orderService.findById(id);
}
```

**Container gotchas:**
```yaml
# Kubernetes limits that break Java apps
resources:
  limits:
    memory: "1Gi"    # JVM doesn't see this by default!
    cpu: "1000m"     # 1 CPU
    
# Fix: Tell JVM about container limits
env:
- name: JAVA_OPTS
  value: "-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0"  # Use 75% of container memory
```

Without MaxRAMPercentage, JVM might try to use more memory than allowed and get OOMKilled.

## Continuous Profiling in Production

### Always-On Profiling

The old way: Wait for problems, then scramble to profile. The better way: Profile continuously with minimal overhead.

```bash
# Continuous JFR with automatic rotation
java -XX:StartFlightRecording=maxsize=100m,maxage=1h,disk=true MyApp
```

This keeps the last hour of profiling data, rotating automatically. When issues happen, the data's already there.

**Smart profiling triggers:**
```java
// Start detailed profiling when things go wrong
if (responseTime.percentile(0.99) > Duration.ofSeconds(2)) {
    startDetailedProfiling("p99-exceeded");
}

if (errorRate.rate() > 0.05) {  // 5% errors
    startDetailedProfiling("high-error-rate");
}
```

Capture detailed data only when needed, keeping overhead low normally.

## SigNoz: Application Performance Monitoring for Java

While SigNoz doesn't provide traditional profiling capabilities like CPU flame graphs or heap dumps, it excels at application performance monitoring (APM) that complements profiling tools. Think of it as the layer that tells you when and where to profile.

### How SigNoz Complements Java Profiling

**Performance Monitoring**: SigNoz tracks p50/p95/p99 latencies, error rates, and throughput. When these metrics spike, you know it's time to break out the profiler.

**Distributed Tracing**: See exactly which service and endpoint is slow across your entire system. This narrows down where to focus your profiling efforts.

**Database Query Insights**: Automatically captures slow queries with full SQL and execution time. Often, you won't even need to profile—the slow query is right there.

**Root Cause Analysis**: Correlate metrics, traces, and logs in one place. When users report issues, quickly identify if it's a code problem (needs profiling) or infrastructure issue.

**Zero-code Setup**: OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation for Spring Boot, JDBC, Redis, Kafka, and more. No code changes required.

### Getting Started with SigNoz

**30-second setup:**
```bash
# Download agent
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar

# Configure (for SigNoz Cloud)
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=YOUR_KEY"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.YOUR_REGION.signoz.cloud:443"

# Run with agent
java -javaagent:opentelemetry-javaagent.jar -jar app.jar
```

That's it. Spring Boot, JDBC, Redis, Kafka—all automatically instrumented.

**Adding custom traces:**
```java
@Autowired Tracer tracer;

public Order processOrder(String orderId) {
    Span span = tracer.spanBuilder("process-order")
        .setAttribute("order.id", orderId)
        .startSpan();
    
    try (var scope = span.makeCurrent()) {
        return orderService.process(orderId);
    } finally {
        span.end();
    }
}
```

Now you'll see "process-order" spans in SigNoz with order IDs for filtering.

### Using SigNoz with Profiling Tools

**Typical workflow:**
1. SigNoz alerts you to performance degradation (p99 latency spike)
2. Use distributed tracing to identify the slow service and endpoint
3. Check if it's a database query issue (often visible in SigNoz)
4. If not, use profiling tools on that specific service to dig deeper
5. After fixing, monitor the improvement in SigNoz

**What SigNoz shows:**
- Service-level performance metrics and trends
- Request flow across microservices with timing
- Database query performance without profiling overhead
- Infrastructure metrics correlated with application performance
- Real user impact of performance issues

**Best practice**: Use SigNoz for continuous monitoring and alerting, then profile specific services when SigNoz identifies performance anomalies. This targeted approach is more efficient than continuous profiling everywhere.

**Deployment options:**
- [SigNoz Cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/): 30-day free trial, no credit card
- [Self-hosted](https://signoz.io/docs/install/): Run on your infrastructure
- [Enterprise](https://signoz.io/contact-us/): BYOC and support options

## Best Practices for Java Profiling

### Make Profiling Part of Development

**CI/CD Integration**
```yaml
# Run performance tests on every PR
- name: Performance Check
  run: |
    # Start app with profiling
    java -XX:StartFlightRecording=duration=60s,filename=profile.jfr -jar app.jar &
    
    # Run load test
    ab -n 10000 -c 100 http://localhost:8080/api/endpoint
    
    # Check results
    jfr print profile.jfr | grep "allocation" | head -20
```

Catch performance regressions before merge, not in production.

**Set Performance Budgets**
```java
// Fail builds if performance degrades
assertThat(p99ResponseTime).isLessThan(Duration.ofMillis(200));
assertThat(cpuUsage).isLessThan(70.0);
assertThat(heapUsed).isLessThan(500_000_000);  // 500MB
```

### Team Practices

**Share profiling knowledge:**
- Store flame graphs and heap dumps in shared location
- Document what you found and how you fixed it
- Create runbooks for common performance issues

**Regular performance reviews:**
```bash
# Weekly performance check
1. Compare this week's p99 to last week
2. Check top 5 slowest endpoints
3. Review any new memory allocation hotspots
4. Look for gradual degradation trends
```

### Choosing Tools

**Quick decision guide:**
- Local development? VisualVM or IDE profiler
- Production CPU issues? Async-profiler
- Memory leaks? Eclipse MAT
- Distributed tracing? SigNoz or similar APM
- Continuous monitoring? JFR + APM tool

**Test overhead before production:**
```bash
# Measure profiling impact
time curl -s http://localhost:8080/load-test  # Baseline
# Enable profiler
time curl -s http://localhost:8080/load-test  # With profiling
# Keep overhead under 5%
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Profiler Won't Connect
```bash
# Check if port is open
netstat -an | grep 5005

# Wrong: Missing address
java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y MyApp

# Right: Specify address
java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=*:5005 MyApp
```

### Profiling Overhead Too High

**Wrong approach**: Full instrumentation in production
**Right approach**: 
```bash
# Use sampling with longer intervals
java -XX:StartFlightRecording=settings=profile.jfc,samplethreads=true,interval=100ms MyApp
```

### Heap Dumps Too Large

```bash
# Compress while dumping (Java 11+)
jcmd <pid> GC.heap_dump -gz /tmp/heap.hprof.gz

# Or analyze without loading entire dump
java -jar mat.jar -application org.eclipse.mat.api.parse heap.hprof \
     org.eclipse.mat.api:suspects > leak-suspects.txt
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with built-in tools**: JFR, jstack, jmap are free and powerful. Learn them first.

2. **Profile the right thing**: CPU for slowness, memory for leaks/OOMs, threads for deadlocks, I/O for external delays.

3. **Production profiling is different**: Always use sampling, keep overhead under 3%, profile continuously not reactively.

4. **Most performance problems are obvious**: That O(n²) algorithm, the missing database index, the synchronization bottleneck. Profiling just helps you find them.

5. **Modern Java needs modern tools**: Distributed tracing for microservices, container-aware profilers for Kubernetes, APM tools for observability.

6. **Make it routine**: Profile during development, in CI/CD, and continuously in production. Performance regressions caught early are easier to fix.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between sampling and instrumentation profiling?

Sampling takes snapshots of your app every few milliseconds—like taking photos of a race. Low overhead (1-3%) but might miss short-lived methods. Instrumentation tracks every method call—like recording video of the entire race. Accurate but adds 10-50% overhead. Use sampling in production, instrumentation for debugging.

### How often should I profile my Java application?

Continuously in production with tools like JFR (low overhead). During development whenever you add significant features. Set up weekly automated performance reports. Profile immediately when users report slowness.

### Can profiling hurt production performance?

Yes, if done wrong. Bad: instrumentation profiling, profiling all classes, writing huge files to disk. Good: sampling profilers, JFR with 1-2% overhead, async-profiler for CPU. Always test overhead first.

### Which profiling tool should I start with?

For beginners: VisualVM (free, GUI, works everywhere). For production: JFR + SigNoz or similar APM. For specific issues: async-profiler (CPU), Eclipse MAT (memory), thread dumps (deadlocks).

### What metrics matter most?

Depends on your problem:
- Slow responses? Check p95/p99 latency and CPU flame graphs
- OOM errors? Monitor heap usage and allocation rate
- System hanging? Look at thread states and lock contention
- High cloud bills? Track CPU usage and memory efficiency
