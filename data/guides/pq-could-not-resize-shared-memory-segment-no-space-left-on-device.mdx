If you‚Äôre running PostgreSQL in Docker, you‚Äôve probably come across the dreaded "PQ: Could Not Resize Shared Memory" error. It can stop your database in its tracks and mess with your app‚Äôs performance. Understanding why this happens and how to fix it is key to keeping your PostgreSQL setup running smoothly.  This guide provides comprehensive strategies to resolve this error, from quick fixes to long-term optimizations.

## What Causes the "PQ: Could Not Resize Shared Memory" Error?

PostgreSQL uses shared memory to let its processes access common data. When PostgreSQL can‚Äôt resize the shared memory segment, you get hit with the error: "pq: could not resize shared memory segment. No space left on the device." It can severely impact database operations, preventing new connections and potentially causing inconsistencies. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the ‚ÄúNo space left on device‚Äù part‚Äîthis usually refers to memory, not disk space.

### Common Causes of Shared Memory Resizing Issues

Here are some common reasons why you might encounter shared memory resizing issues:

1. Docker's Default Shared Memory Limit: Docker containers come with a default shared memory limit of 64MB, which often isn‚Äôt enough for PostgreSQL.
2. System-wide Shared Memory Restrictions: Your operating system might have strict limits on shared memory allocation.
3. Insufficient Disk Space: The error message might be misleading; it‚Äôs often about memory, not disk space.
4. Misconfigured PostgreSQL Settings: Parameters like `shared_buffers` might be set too high, leading to excessive memory demands.

## Quick Fix: Increasing Docker Shared Memory Size

For Docker users, a quick solution involves increasing the shared memory allocation for the PostgreSQL container. Here's how:

1. Stop your PostgreSQL container:
    
    ```
    docker stop <container_name>
    ```
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/pq-could-not-resize-shared-memory-segment-no-space-left-on-device-image%201.webp" alt="Stopping PostgreSQL container" caption="Stopping PostgreSQL container" />
    
2. Restart the container with increased shared memory:
    
    ```
    docker run --shm-size="1g" --name <container_name> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="<password>" <your_postgres_image>
    ```
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/09/pq-could-not-resize-shared-memory-segment-no-space-left-on-device-image%202.webp" alt="Restarting PostgreSQL container with increased shared memory" caption="Restarting PostgreSQL container with increased shared memory" />
    

This command allocates 1GB of shared memory to the container. Adjust the value based on your specific needs and system resources.

Considerations:

- Ensure your host system has sufficient memory to accommodate the increase.
- This change is temporary; you must specify the `-shm-size` option each time you start the container.

## Long-term Solutions for Shared Memory Management

While the quick fix gets your container back on its feet, you‚Äôll want to address the root causes to prevent future errors. Here‚Äôs how to do that.

### 1. Optimize PostgreSQL Settings

Tweaking PostgreSQL‚Äôs memory-related settings can help you avoid running into shared memory limits:

- shared_buffers: This parameter defines how much memory PostgreSQL uses for caching data. Aim to set it to about 25% of your system‚Äôs total RAM.
    
    ```bash
    shared_buffers = 1GB
    ```
    
- work_mem: This controls how much memory is used for operations like sorting. Start with 4MB and adjust based on your system‚Äôs load.
    
    ```bash
    work_mem = 4MB
    ```
    
- maintenance_work_mem: This setting is for maintenance tasks like `VACUUM` and `CREATE INDEX`.
    
    ```bash
    maintenance_work_mem = 64MB
    ```
    

Make sure to test each change carefully to find the sweet spot for your configuration. 

Note: These configurations can be updated by making use of the PostgreSQL configuration file which needs to be used for starting the container. 

### 2. Manage Resources in Containers

If you‚Äôre using Docker or Kubernetes, properly allocating memory to your containers is key.

- In Docker Compose, you can add memory limits like this:
    
    ```yaml
    services:
      postgres:
        shm_size: '1gb'
    ```
    
- In Kubernetes, you‚Äôll want to set resource requests and limits for your pods:
    
    ```yaml
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "1Gi"
      limits:
        memory: "2Gi"
    ```
    

### 3. Monitor Your Memory Usage

You can avoid running into shared memory errors by keeping an eye on PostgreSQL‚Äôs memory usage. Use monitoring tools like SigNoz to track shared memory consumption and get alerts when it‚Äôs getting close to the limit.

## Troubleshooting Shared Memory Issues in Different Environments

Shared memory problems can manifest differently across various deployment environments:

1. Bare-metal installations:
    - Check system-wide shared memory limits:
        
        ```
        sysctl -a | grep kernel.shm
        
        ```
        
    - Adjust limits in `/etc/sysctl.conf` if necessary.
2. Virtual machines:
    - Ensure the VM is allocated sufficient memory.
    - Check hypervisor settings for any memory limitations.
3. Kubernetes:
    - Use resource requests and limits in pod specifications:
        
        ```yaml
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "1Gi"
          limits:
            memory: "2Gi"
        
        ```
        
    - Consider using a StorageClass that supports volume expansion for persistent volumes.

PostgreSQL Memory Settings

Given you need to configure various memory-related settings in PostgreSQL, it will be helpful to understand various memory types and their use.

- Shared Buffers
    - Role: Shared memory area used for caching data and index pages. It helps reduce the need to access a disk for frequently accessed data.
    - Default Value: Typically around 128MB, but varies by installation.
- Work Memory
    - Role: Memory used for internal operations such as sorting and hash tables. Each query operation gets its work memory.
    - Default Value: Usually set to 4MB.
- Maintenance Work Memory
    - Role: Memory used for maintenance operations like `VACUUM`, `CREATE INDEX`, and `ALTER TABLE`. This memory is used during operations that need more memory for temporary data.
    - Default Value: Typically set to 64MB
- Temp Buffers
    - Role: Memory used for temporary data that is not permanent, such as temporary tables and complex query operations.
    - Default Value: Usually set to 8MB.
- Effective Cache Size
    - Role: A rough estimate of how much memory is available for disk caching by the operating system and PostgreSQL. It helps the query planner estimate how much memory is available for caching data.
    - Default Value: Often set to 4GB or more, depending on the system's RAM.
- Shared Memory (Docker-specific)
    - Role: Controls the amount of memory allocated for inter-process communication (IPC) within Docker containers. Not directly a PostgreSQL setting, but affects how PostgreSQL and other processes within the container handle shared memory.

## Best Practices to Prevent Shared Memory Errors

Shared memory errors in PostgreSQL can severely impact performance and stability. To prevent these errors, it‚Äôs essential to follow best practices for managing and configuring shared memory. Here are some effective strategies:

### 1. Configure Shared Memory Appropriately

- Adjust `shared_buffers`: This setting controls the amount of memory PostgreSQL uses for caching data. Ensure it's set to a value that balances performance and available system memory. For most systems, a common recommendation is to allocate 25% of the total system RAM.
    
    ```sql
    ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_buffers = '1GB'; -- Adjust based on your system
    ```
    

### 2. Monitor Shared Memory Usage

- Regular Monitoring: Use tools like `pg_stat_activity` and `pg_stat_database` to monitor memory usage. Track the amount of memory used and check for potential issues.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;
    SELECT * FROM pg_stat_database;
    ```
    
- Check for Errors: Review PostgreSQL logs for any warnings or errors related to shared memory. Configure your logging to capture detailed information.
    
    ```sql
    SET log_min_messages = 'WARNING'; -- Adjust the logging level as needed
    ```
    

### 3. Optimize PostgreSQL Configuration

- Tune `work_mem`: This setting controls the amount of memory allocated for operations like sorting and hashing. Set it appropriately to avoid excessive memory consumption during complex queries.
    
    ```sql
    ALTER SYSTEM SET work_mem = '4MB'; -- Adjust based on query needs
    ```
    
- Adjust `maintenance_work_mem`: This setting determines the amount of memory used for maintenance tasks like vacuuming and indexing. Ensure it‚Äôs sufficient to avoid long-running maintenance operations.
    
    ```sql
    ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '64MB'; -- Adjust based on workload
    ```
    

### 4. Proper Resource Allocation

- Avoid Overcommitment: Ensure that PostgreSQL does not overcommit system memory. Properly size your database and its resources to avoid hitting limits.
- Regularly Reevaluate Settings: As your database grows and your workload changes, regularly review and adjust memory settings to align with current needs.

### 5. Perform Routine Maintenance

- Regular Vacuuming: Perform regular vacuum operations to prevent bloat and manage memory efficiently.
    
    ```sql
    VACUUM ANALYZE;
    ```
    
- Index Management: Regularly review and optimize indexes to improve query performance and memory usage.

### 6. Plan for Scaling

- Scale Resources: If you consistently hit memory limits, consider scaling up your hardware or adjusting PostgreSQL‚Äôs configuration to better handle the load.
- Use Connection Pooling: Implement connection pooling to manage the number of active connections and reduce memory overhead.

## FAQs

### What is shared memory in PostgreSQL and why is it important?

Shared memory in PostgreSQL is a segment of RAM used by the database to cache frequently accessed data and facilitate inter-process communication. It's crucial for performance as it significantly reduces disk I/O and speeds up query execution.

### How can I check the current shared memory usage in my PostgreSQL instance?

You can check shared memory usage using the PostgreSQL system view `pg_shmem_allocations`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_shmem_allocations;
```

This query shows all shared memory allocations and their sizes.

In PostgreSQL version 12 and earlier, the `pg_shmem_allocations` system catalog doesn't exist, as it was introduced in PostgreSQL 13 to provide insight into shared memory allocations. So there is no direct way to fetch the details. Instead you can make use of  the command 

```java
SELECT buffers_checkpoint, buffers_clean, buffers_backend, buffers_alloc
FROM pg_stat_bgwriter;`
// Shared buffers are a key part of shared memory in PostgreSQL. You can check how much of the shared buffers are being used by looking at the pg_stat_bgwriter view.
```

### Are there any risks associated with increasing shared memory size?

While increasing shared memory can improve performance, it also comes with risks:

- Overconsumption of system memory, potentially impacting other processes
- Increased startup time for PostgreSQL as it allocates larger memory segments
- Potential system instability if shared memory is set too high relative to available RAM

Always test changes thoroughly and increase shared memory gradually.

### Can shared memory issues affect PostgreSQL performance even without errors?

Yes, insufficient shared memory can impact performance without triggering explicit errors. Symptoms include:

- Slower query execution times
- Increased disk I/O
- Higher CPU usage

Regular monitoring of PostgreSQL performance metrics can help identify these issues before they become critical.
