PromQL, the query language for Prometheus, is a powerful tool for analyzing time-series data. However, you may encounter challenges when dealing with incomplete datasets or gaps in your time series. These issues can significantly impact your visualizations and analysis. This guide will show you how to merge zero values with existing metrics in PromQL, ensuring more accurate and comprehensive data representation.

## Understanding PromQL and the Need for Merging Zero Values

PromQL, the query language used by Prometheus, is essential for selecting and aggregating time series data. Metrics—numerical measurements collected over time—are at the heart of PromQL and provide valuable insights into system performance.

However, when analyzing data, you may often encounter missing data points. These gaps can be caused by network issues, service downtime, or inconsistent data collection, leading to incomplete or inaccurate results.

Missing data can result in:

- Visualizations that don't reflect the full picture: A brief network outage could leave gaps in your CPU usage graph, making it seem like the system was underutilized.

- Aggregations that skew your analysis: Missing intervals in request rate data could lower the average, misleading you into thinking traffic was lighter than it was.
- Alerts that trigger incorrectly: If data collection fails, Prometheus might interpret it as zero usage, triggering false alarms.

To address these problems, you need to merge zero values with your existing metrics. This approach fills the gaps, ensuring a complete dataset for reliable analysis and accurate visualizations.

## The vector(0) Function in PromQL

PromQL provides the `vector(0)` function, which generates a constant zero value for every time series that doesn’t have a data point at a particular timestamp. This function allows you to merge zero values into your queries, effectively filling gaps in your data.

Here's the basic syntax:

```
vector(0)
```

This function creates a time series with a value of 0 for every timestamp in your query range. You can use it to fill gaps in your data or provide a baseline for comparisons.

### How `vector(0)` Generates a Constant Zero Value for All-Time Series

The `vector(0)` function in PromQL converts the scalar value `0` into a vector, assigning a constant `0` to all active time series at the current evaluation time. In particular, the vector(0) function has the following behavior:

- Current Time Evaluation: Prometheus evaluates the query at a specific timestamp, and `vector(0)` applies the value `0` to all time series in the query context.
- Filling Gaps: If a time series lacks data at that moment, `vector(0)` ensures it receives a `0`, filling any gaps in the data.
- No Labels: `vector(0)` doesn’t add labels by default, but assigns a `0` value to all active time series at the evaluation time, regardless of their existing label sets.

Keep in mind:

- `vector(0)` doesn't have any labels by default
- It applies to all-time series in your query context

While the `vector(0)` function is helpful for filling gaps, it doesn’t automatically merge with other metric values. You’ll need to combine it with your metrics using the techniques explained in the next section.

## How to Merge Zero Values with Metrics

To merge zero values with your existing metrics, you'll primarily use the `or` operator in combination with `vector(0)`. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Start with your metric query:
    
    ```
    http_requests_total
    ```
    
2. Add the `or` operator and `vector(0)`:
    
    ```
    http_requests_total or vector(0)
    ```
    

This query returns the `http_requests_total` metric where it exists and 0 where it doesn't.

Handling Label Matching When Merging Zero Values

When merging zero values with metrics, label matching is crucial. Prometheus matches time series based on their labels, so both sides of the `or` operation must have compatible label sets.

- No Labels on `vector(0)`: By default, `vector(0)` doesn’t carry any labels. This can cause mismatches when comparing it with a metric that has labels.
- Using `label_replace()`: To ensure correct label matching, you can use the `label_replace()` function to align the labels of `vector(0)` with your metrics:
    
    ```
    http_requests_total or label_replace(vector(0), "job", "my_service", "", "")
    ```
    
    In this example, `label_replace()` assigns a `"job"` label to `vector(0)`, allowing it to match the `http_requests_total` metric's labels. This way, zero values are merged correctly, even when labels are involved.
    

Best practices for merging zero values:

- Always use specific label matches to avoid unintended data expansion
- Consider the time range of your query to limit unnecessary zero values
- Test queries with sample data to catch edge cases where gaps may persist.

### Advanced Merging Techniques

In more complex scenarios, you might need to merge zero values across multi-dimensional time series or apply conditions for selective zero value insertion. PromQL offers several advanced techniques for handling such cases.

Using `group_left` and `group_right`

For complex scenarios, you can use `group_left` and `group_right` to handle many-to-one and one-to-many relationships:

```
<metric_name> * on(<labels>) group_left <label_for_grouping> or vector(0)
```

An example query:

```
system_resource_usage * on(instance, exported_instance) group_left error_rate or vector(0)
```

Query Explanation

- `group_left`: Matches `system_resource_usage` with `error_rate` for each instance and exported instance, ensuring that missing error values are filled with `0`.
- `or vector(0)`: Fills missing values with `0` for better visualization.

Time-Based Conditions

In some cases, you may not want to fill gaps for every time series. You can set conditions to selectively insert zero values based on the time window or specific criteria. For example, you might only merge zero values for metrics collected in the last 24 hours:

```
metric_name or (vector(0) unless metric_name[24h])
```

## Practical Applications and Use Cases

Merging zero values with metrics has several practical applications:

1. Web Application Performance Monitoring
    - Use Case: A retail website may show no sales on low-traffic days.
    - Application: Using `sales_total or vector(0)` fills gaps, allowing accurate daily performance analysis.
2. API Health Monitoring
    - Use Case: An API service experiences inactivity during maintenance.
    - Application: Merging `api_requests_total or vector(0)` provides accurate visualizations of usage patterns, including periods of inactivity.
3. Infrastructure Resource Management
    - Use Case: Cloud applications can have idle instances with no reported metrics.
    - Application: Applying `cpu_usage or vector(0)` shows zero usage during downtime, aiding resource allocation decisions.
4. CI/CD Monitoring
    - Use Case: A CI/CD pipeline may not report metrics during non-deployment periods.
    - Application: Using `deployment_count or vector(0)` maintains consistent deployment activity tracking.
5. Network Traffic Analysis
    - Use Case: A network may experience periods of inactivity.
    - Application: Using `packet_drops or vector(0)` visualizes times with zero drops, improving network health monitoring.

## Optimizing Performance When Merging Zero Values

While merging zero values improves data completeness, it can impact query performance. To optimize your queries:

1. Limit time ranges: Use shorter time ranges to reduce the number of zero values generated.
2. Use specific label matches: Narrow down your data set to only the necessary metrics.
3. Leverage query caching: Frequently used queries with zero value merging can benefit from caching.
4. Consider pre-aggregation: For large datasets, pre-aggregate data to reduce the load on PromQL queries.

## FAQs

### What is the difference between null and zero in PromQL?

Null represents the absence of data, while zero is a valid data point with a value of 0. Merging zero values replaces null values with explicit zeros for more consistent data analysis.

### How does merging zero values affect aggregation functions?

Merging zero values can significantly impact aggregations. For example, an average calculation will include zero values, potentially lowering the overall result. Always consider the implications of zero values on your specific aggregation needs.

### Can I use vector(0) with other constant values?

Yes, you can use other constant values with the `vector()` function. For example, `vector(1)` would create a time series with a constant value of 1. This can be useful for baseline comparisons or normalization.

### Are there alternatives to vector(0) for handling missing data in PromQL?

While `vector(0)` is the most common method, you can also use:

1. `default()` function to specify a default value
2. `absent()` function to detect missing time series
3. Custom recording rules to pre-process data and fill gaps

Choose the method that best fits your specific use case and performance requirements.
