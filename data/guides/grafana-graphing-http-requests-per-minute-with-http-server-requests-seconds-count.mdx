Monitoring HTTP requests is crucial for understanding your web application's performance and user experience. Grafana, a powerful open-source visualization tool, combined with Prometheus, offers an effective way to track and analyze HTTP request rates. This guide will walk you through graphing HTTP requests per minute in Grafana using the `http_server_requests_seconds_count` metric.

## Understanding HTTP Requests Monitoring in Grafana

HTTP requests are the core of any web application, facilitating communication between users and servers. Monitoring these requests is crucial for maintaining the health and performance of your application. By tracking HTTP requests, you can identify traffic patterns, performance bottlenecks, and potential issues that may impact user experience.

The key metric in HTTP request monitoring is `http_server_requests_seconds_count`. This metric, typically exported by your application, counts the number of HTTP requests received by your server. Prometheus, a widely used monitoring and alerting toolkit, collects this data and stores it in a time-series format.

Grafana, in turn, acts as the visualization platform. It enables you to create detailed, real-time dashboards that help monitor and analyze HTTP requests. By connecting Grafana with Prometheus, you can easily query the `http_server_requests_seconds_count` metric, visualize it in graphs, and interpret patterns or anomalies in HTTP traffic over time.

With this setup, developers can quickly understand how their application is performing, spot trends in request volume, and address issues like high latency or traffic spikes.

## Setting Up Grafana and Prometheus for HTTP Request Monitoring

This section walks you through setting up Grafana and Prometheus to monitor HTTP requests by scraping application metrics and visualizing them in Grafana. Monitoring HTTP requests is essential for understanding how your application performs under different conditions, identifying potential bottlenecks, and ensuring that your services are reliable and responsive. By integrating Prometheus to collect metrics from your application and Grafana to visualize these metrics, you can create insightful dashboards that provide real-time insights into the health of your system and improve your overall observability.

### Expose Metrics from Your Application

To monitor your application's performance with Prometheus, the application must expose metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format. Many web frameworks and programming languages provide libraries that simplify the process of exposing these metrics via an HTTP endpoint.

For Java-based applications, libraries like Micrometer and the Prometheus Java Client are commonly used to expose metrics. A sample [Java application](https://signoz.io/guides/monitoring-java-applications/#signoz-a-modern-approach-to-java-application-monitoring) has been provided. Follow the steps below to expose metrics for the application. If you have an existing application already exposing metrics in Prometheus format, skip this step and move on to configuring Prometheus.

1. Add the Micrometer Dependency
For a Spring Boot application, you’ll need to add the Micrometer dependency to your project. This will allow your app to export its metrics in a format that Prometheus understands.
    
    If you're using Maven, add this to your `pom.xml` file:
    
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
        <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```
    
2. Configure your Application
Configure the application to expose the Prometheus metrics by enabling the Actuator endpoints in your `application.properties` file located at `src/main/resources`:
    
    ```
    management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=prometheus
    management.endpoint.prometheus.enabled=true
    ```
    
3. Access the Prometheus Endpoint
    
    Once your application is running, the Prometheus metrics will be available at `http://localhost:8090/actuator/prometheus`
    Open the URL in your browser or use a tool like `curl` to check if the metrics are being exposed properly.

### Set up Prometheus to scrape metrics

Now that your application is exposing metrics, you need to configure Prometheus to collect those metrics. Prometheus does this by periodically checking the endpoint where your metrics are exposed (this process is called scraping).

1. Modify the Prometheus Configuration File
    
    Modify the `prometheus.yml` configuration file to specify the targets Prometheus should scrape metrics from. Add the endpoint of your application under the `scrape_configs` section:
    
    ```yaml
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'my_application'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:8080']
    ```
    
2. Start Prometheus
    
    To start Prometheus, use the appropriate command based on your installation. For example, If you’ve manually downloaded the Prometheus binary, you can start Prometheus with this command on Linux:
    
    ```bash
    ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
    ```
    
3. Confirm Prometheus is Scraping Your Application’s Metrics
    
    Open Prometheus in the browser by navigating to `http://localhost:9090`. Click on Status > Targets to check if your application’s target is in the UP state.

### Tips for Ensuring Proper Integration Between Your Application, Prometheus, and Grafana

Integrating Prometheus and Grafana with your application can significantly enhance your monitoring and observability capabilities. To ensure a seamless experience, consider the following best practices:

1. Use Clear Metric Names
Always give your metrics meaningful names, so it’s easy to understand what they measure. For example, instead of using `request_count`, use `http_requests_total` for clarity.
2. Make the Most of Labels
Labels help categorize and filter your data. Use them to add context like status codes (`status_code="200"`) or response times. This makes analysis in Grafana easier.
3. Set the Right Scraping Interval
Adjust how often Prometheus collects data based on your app’s traffic. A typical interval is 15 seconds, but don’t set it too low, or it might slow down your system.
4. Check Your Metrics Endpoint
Before launching, use tools like `curl` or Postman to ensure your app’s metrics endpoint works and displays data in Prometheus format. Catching issues early can save you headaches later.
5. Keep an Eye on Prometheus’ Performance
As your app grows, Prometheus might get bogged down. Monitor its CPU, memory, and disk usage, and adjust settings like retention periods if needed.
6. Document Everything
Keep notes on what each metric means, either in your code or a separate file. This helps everyone on your team understand your monitoring setup.
7. Update Dashboards and Alerts
Regularly check your Grafana dashboards and alerts to make sure they’re still relevant. Remove outdated metrics and add new ones as your app changes.

## Creating a Dashboard for HTTP Requests per Minute

With Prometheus now scraping your application's metrics, follow these steps to create a Grafana dashboard to visualize HTTP requests per minute:

1. Create New Dashboard
    
    In the left-hand menu, select Dashboards and click the Create dashboard button.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/grafana-graphing-http-requests-per-minute-with-http-server-requests-seconds-count-Screenshot_2024-10-04_at_11.42.37.webp" alt="Create dashboard" caption="Create dashboard" />
    
    Click the Add visualization button
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/grafana-graphing-http-requests-per-minute-with-http-server-requests-seconds-count-fec50360-ee07-4569-ab85-8794820adb6d.webp" alt="Adding visualization" caption="Adding visualization" />
    
    Select Prometheus as the data source
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/grafana-graphing-http-requests-per-minute-with-http-server-requests-seconds-count-093fbf6f-d2be-4924-8991-4961ca31fff0.webp" alt="Select datasource" caption="Select datasource" />
    
2. Use PromQL to Run Queries
    
    To query the HTTP request metrics from the application, in the panel's query editor, enter the following PromQL query to calculate the rate of HTTP requests over the last minute:
    
    ```json
    rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{}[1m])
    ```
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/grafana-graphing-http-requests-per-minute-with-http-server-requests-seconds-count-Screenshot_2024-09-29_at_12.12.25_PM.webp" alt="Querying HTTP request rate over the last minute" caption="Querying HTTP request rate over the last minute" />
    
    This query retrieves the per-second rate of HTTP requests based on the `http_server_requests_seconds_count` metric. It calculates how many requests are happening every second, averaged over a one-minute window. This is useful for monitoring real-time traffic patterns and understanding how request volume changes over time.
    
3. Set the Unit to Requests Per Minute
After running the query, you’ll want to format the result to show requests per minute instead of per second. In the Panel settings on the right, scroll to the Standard options section. Here, you can set the Unit dropdown to display the rate in seconds, which represents the requests per second.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/grafana-graphing-http-requests-per-minute-with-http-server-requests-seconds-count-Screenshot_2024-10-03_at_9.21.33_AM.webp" alt="Unit response set to seconds" caption="Unit response set to seconds" />
    
    Since Grafana doesn’t have a built-in option to display requests per minute, you will need to manually convert the per-second rate by multiplying it by 60, which leads us to the next step.
    
4. Multiply by 60:
    
    To calculate requests per minute, modify your query to multiply the per-second rate by 60. This will convert the requests-per-second data into requests-per-minute. Update your PromQL query like this:
    
    ```
    rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count[1m]) * 60
    ```
    
    This adjusted query takes the per-second rate over the last minute and multiplies it by 60 to show the total number of requests made each minute.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/grafana-graphing-http-requests-per-minute-with-http-server-requests-seconds-count-Screenshot_2024-09-29_at_1.18.04_PM.webp" alt="http_server_requests_seconds_count dashboard" caption="http_server_requests_seconds_count dashboard" />
    
5. Customize the Panel
To improve the readability and relevance of your dashboard, it's helpful to customize the panel:
    1. Set the panel title: In the General tab, rename the panel to something more descriptive, such as "`HTTP Requests per Minute`." This makes it easier to understand the panel’s purpose at a glance.
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/grafana-graphing-http-requests-per-minute-with-http-server-requests-seconds-count-Screenshot_2024-09-29_at_1.18.04_PM%201.webp" alt="changing the name of the panel tile" caption="changing the name of the panel tile" />
        
    2. Customize as per needs: 
    You can configure the Y-axis to automatically adjust to the scale of incoming request rates or set a custom range based on your expected traffic volume. In the Display settings, you can also fine-tune the legend to provide more context about the data shown on the dashboard.
    3. Apply the changes:
    Once you’ve customized the panel to meet your needs, click Apply to save your settings and add the panel to the dashboard.
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/grafana-graphing-http-requests-per-minute-with-http-server-requests-seconds-count-Screenshot_2024-09-29_at_1.32.56_PM.webp" alt="Dashboard overview" caption="Dashboard overview" />
        
    4. `Optional` - Set Up Alerts
    To stay informed of significant changes in HTTP request rates, you can configure alerts in Grafana. Alerts will notify you when specific conditions are met, such as sudden spikes or drops in traffic.
        1. Add alerts:
        Go to the Alert tab in the panel configuration, where you can define thresholds for high or low request rates that will trigger notifications. This can be useful for early detection of performance issues or traffic anomalies.
        To know more about Setting up the Alerts you follow the official docs <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Crafting the Perfect PromQL Query

PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) is essential for extracting and analyzing metrics from your monitoring setup. Here's a breakdown of the basic structure of a PromQL query, focusing on how to monitor HTTP requests:

Understanding the Query Components

1. Metric Selection:
`http_server_requests_seconds_count{}`: This part of the query selects all the time series associated with the metric `http_server_requests_seconds_count`, which tracks the number of HTTP requests over time. The empty `{}` allows you to filter further using labels (such as status codes or URIs) if needed.
2. Time Range:
`[1m]`: This specifies the time frame during which the rate is calculated—in this example, a 1-minute window. You may change this depending on your analytical requirements, such as tracking trends over shorter or longer intervals.
3. Rate Calculation:
`rate()`: The `rate()` function computes the average per-second rate of increase for the metric within the specified time range. It helps you understand how fast HTTP requests are being received by the server.

### Practical Adjustments for Different Scenarios

1. Hourly Request Rates:
If you want to calculate the request rate per hour instead of per second, you can adjust the time range and multiply by the number of seconds in an hour:
    
    ```lua
    rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{}[1h]) * 3600
    ```
    
    This query calculates the per-second rate over the past hour and multiplies it by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour) to give you requests per hour.
    
2. Filtering by Specific Endpoint:
If you're interested in monitoring requests to a particular endpoint, you can filter the metric by its URI label:
    
    ```lua
    rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{uri="/api/users"}[1m]) * 60
    ```
    
    This query monitors only the requests to the `/api/users` endpoint over a 1-minute period, multiplied by 60 to get the requests per minute.
    
3. Grouping by Status Code:
To analyze request patterns by status codes (e.g., 200, 404), you can use the `sum by (status)` clause to group requests based on their HTTP status:
    
    ```lua
    sum by (status) (rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{}[1m])) * 60
    ```
    
    This query calculates the request rate for each status code and aggregates them, showing you the number of requests per minute, broken down by their status (e.g., success, errors).
    

## Interpreting and Analyzing HTTP Request Graphs

Understanding the information presented in your HTTP request graphs is key to gaining insights into your application's performance and usage patterns. Here's how to interpret different trends and what they may indicate:

- A rapid rise in HTTP requests frequently indicates a spike in traffic. This might be attributed to an organic rise in user engagement, such as a promotional campaign or the introduction of a new feature. However, it might also indicate an external issue, such as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) assault, in which malicious traffic overwhelms your server. Investigating these surges helps to discover the source and whether scaling or security measures are required.
- If your graph shows consistent peaks and valleys over time, these may represent predictable daily or weekly usage trends. For instance, your application might receive more requests during business hours or specific days of the week. Identifying these patterns allows you to plan resources more efficiently, such as allocating more server capacity during peak times or scheduling maintenance during periods of low activity.
- A sharp decline in the number of HTTP requests could be a red flag, suggesting a service outage, network failure, or an application malfunction. In this scenario, immediate investigation is crucial to restore normal operations and minimize downtime. Correlating the drop with other system metrics, such as server health or error logs, can help pinpoint the root cause.

By analyzing HTTP request graphs in Grafana, you can make informed decisions to optimize your application's performance:

- Identify peak usage times: Recognizing when your application experiences the highest traffic helps in resource planning, allowing you to allocate sufficient infrastructure to handle demand without over-provisioning during low-traffic periods.
- Detect and investigate anomalies: Whether it’s a sudden spike, unexpected pattern, or sharp drop, identifying anomalies in your request data gives you the opportunity to investigate and resolve potential performance issues before they escalate. Early detection can prevent larger problems, such as system crashes or slow response times.
- Correlate request rates with other metrics: To get a full picture of your application's health, correlate request rates with other key performance indicators, such as response times, error rates, or CPU usage. For example, an increase in request rates alongside a rise in error rates might indicate that your application is struggling to handle traffic, requiring optimizations to improve stability and responsiveness.

## Best Practices for HTTP Request Monitoring with Grafana

1. Set up alerts: Configure alerts for unusual spikes or drops in HTTP request rates to quickly address traffic surges, outages, or potential issues.
2. Use appropriate time ranges: Short time ranges for real-time monitoring; longer time ranges for trend analysis over days, weeks, or months.
3. Combine with other metrics: Pair HTTP request data with metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and database performance for a comprehensive view of your application’s health.
4. Regularly update dashboards: Review and adjust dashboards to ensure they remain relevant as your application grows or changes.
5. Monitor specific endpoints: Use PromQL labels to focus on critical endpoints or APIs, allowing you to monitor performance and detect issues specific to key parts of your application.
6. Track status codes: Filter HTTP requests by status codes (e.g., 2xx, 4xx, 5xx) to identify successful transactions, client errors, or server failures, helping pinpoint where issues may occur.
7. Use efficient data retention: Set appropriate data retention policies in Prometheus to balance long-term trend analysis and resource management, ensuring that you don’t overconsume storage while still tracking historical data.
8. Leverage panel types in Grafana: Use different Grafana panel types, such as heatmaps, histograms, or tables, to better visualize specific aspects of HTTP request data and gain deeper insights.
