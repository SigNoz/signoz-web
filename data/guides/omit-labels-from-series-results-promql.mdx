PromQL, Prometheus’s query language, uses labels to identify time series data. While labels are crucial for data organization, there are scenarios where you need to omit certain labels from your query results. This process can significantly improve query performance and simplify data visualization. 

In this guide, you'll learn various techniques to omit labels in PromQL, optimize your Grafana dashboards, and explore how modern monitoring solutions like SigNoz can streamline label management.

## Understanding PromQL Labels and their Importance

PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) is the powerful query language used in Prometheus, a popular open-source monitoring and alerting system. At the heart of PromQL are labels—key-value pairs that uniquely identify time series. Labels in PromQL are key-value pairs attached to time series data. 

For example:

```
http_requests_total{method="GET", status="200"}
```

Here, `method` and `status` are labels that differentiate metrics within the `http_requests_total` series.

Labels serve several critical functions in Prometheus:

1. Identification: Labels uniquely identify time series within a metric name.
2. Filtering: You can use labels to filter and select specific sets of time series.
3. Grouping: Labels allow you to group related time series for aggregation operations.
4. Context: They provide additional context about the source and nature of the metric data.

## Why You Might Need to Omit Labels from Series Results

While labels are invaluable for data organization, there are scenarios where omitting certain labels becomes necessary or beneficial:

1. Query Performance: Excessive labels can slow down query execution, especially when dealing with high-cardinality data.
2. Data Visualization: Too many labels can clutter graphs and dashboards, making it difficult to focus on the most relevant information.
3. Aggregation Clarity: When performing aggregations, some labels may become irrelevant or misleading in the resulting dataset.
4. Resource Optimization: Reducing the number of labels can decrease the storage and processing requirements for your monitoring system.
5. Simplified Analysis: Fewer labels can make it easier to spot trends and patterns in your data without distracting details.

You can optimize query performance, reduce system load, and maintain clean, focused dashboards by strategically omitting labels.

## Techniques to Omit Labels in PromQL

PromQL offers several methods to omit labels from your query results. Let's explore the most common and effective techniques:

### Using the `without` Clause

The `without` clause allows you to exclude specific labels from the result set.

Syntax:

```java
<aggregation-operation> without (<labels to omit>) (<metric>)
```

Example:

```sql
sum without (instance,job) (prometheus_http_requests_total)
```

This query sums up all HTTP requests but removes the `instance` and `job` labels from the result.

### Leveraging the `by` Clause

The `by` clause is the opposite of `without` — it specifies which labels to keep.

Syntax:

```java
<aggregation-operation> by (<labels to keep>) (<metric>)
```

Example:

```sql
sum by (code,handler) (prometheus_http_requests_total)
```

This query retains only the `method` and `status_code` labels, effectively omitting all others.

### Manipulating Labels with `label_replace`

When you need to modify or create labels in PromQL, `label_replace` is a versatile function. It allows you to transform label values or generate new labels based on existing ones.

The syntax of `label_replace` is:

```
label_replace(vector, "new_label", "replacement", "source_label", "regex")
```

- `vector`: The input metric or query.
- `new_label`: The name of the new label to create or modify.
- `replacement`: The value assigned to `new_label`, which can include parts of `source_label` captured by the regex.
- `source_label`: The label whose value will be used for the transformation.
- `regex`: A regular expression to match the desired part of the `source_label`.

Suppose you have a metric `up` with a label `instance`, and you want to create a new label called `new_label` that copies the value from `instance`. Use:

```
label_replace(up, "new_label", "$1", "instance", "(.*)")
```

What it does:

- `up` - The input vector/metric to be modified
- `"new_label"` - This specifies the name of the new label to be created (or replaced if it already exists)
- `"$1"` - The value to assign to the `new_label`. Here, `$1` refers to the first (and only) captured group in the regular expression
- `"instance"` -  The existing/source label from which the value is extracted. The operation looks at the `instance` label in the `up` metric for matching
- `"(.*)”` - A regular expression pattern used to match the value of the `instance` label
    - `.*` matches the entire value of the label
    - The parentheses `()` define a capture group, so the entire matched value becomes the first group (`$1`), which is used as the replacement value for `new_label`

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/11/omit-labels-from-series-results-promql-image%203.webp" alt="Query result without label replacement" caption="Query result without label replacement" />

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/11/omit-labels-from-series-results-promql-image%204.webp" alt="Query result with new result" caption="Query result with new result" />

Note: By default, `label_replace` adds a new label without removing the old one. 

To remove the old label (`instance` in this example) after using `label_replace`, you can pair it with the `without` or `by` clauses to exclude unwanted labels.

Example:

```
sum without (instance) (label_replace(up, "new_label", "$1", "instance", "(.*)"))
```

- `label_replace(up, "new_label", "$1", "instance", "(.*)")`: Creates the new label `new_label` by copying the value from the `instance` label
- `without (instance)`: Excludes the original `instance` label from the result

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/11/omit-labels-from-series-results-promql-image%205.webp" alt="" caption="" />### Example: Omitting Instance and Pod Labels

Let's walk through a practical example of omitting `instance` and `pod` labels from a Kubernetes deployment metric:

```
sum without (instance, pod) (kube_deployment_spec_replicas)
```

This query:

- Selects the `kube_deployment_spec_replicas` metric
- Sums up the values across all series
- Removes the `instance` and `pod` labels from the result

The output will show the total number of desired replicas for each deployment, without the noise of individual instance and pod information.

## Advanced Label Manipulation in PromQL

For more complex scenarios, PromQL offers advanced techniques for label manipulation:

### Regex-based Label Selection

You can use regular expressions to select or exclude labels based on patterns:

```
sum without (instance) (prometheus_http_requests_total{handler=~"/api/.*"})
```

This query sums up HTTP requests for all handlers starting with "/api" and removes the `instance` label.

### Label Joins for Combining labels

The `label_join` function in PromQL is used to combine multiple label values into a single label, using a specified separator. This is particularly useful when you need to create consolidated labels for easier filtering or grouping.

Syntax

```
label_join(vector, "dst_label", "separator", "src_label_1", "src_label_2", ...)
```

- `vector`: The input metric or query.
- `dst_label`: The name of the destination label to create or modify.
- `separator`: A string used to separate the values.
- `src_label_1`, `src_label_2`, ...: The source labels whose values will be joined.

Example:

```sql
label_join(prometheus_http_requests_total, "endpoint", "/", "instance", "handler")
```

This query combines the `instance` and `handler` labels into a new `endpoint` label, separated by a `/`.

### Best Practices for Label Omission

When omitting labels, keep these best practices in mind:

1. Maintain Context: Ensure that omitting labels doesn't remove critical context from your data.
2. Document Decisions: Keep track of which labels you're omitting and why, especially for complex queries.
3. Balance Performance and Clarity: Strive for a balance between query performance and result clarity.
4. Consistent Naming: Use consistent label names across your metrics to make omission patterns more predictable.

## Optimizing Grafana Dashboards with Label Omission

Grafana, a popular visualization tool often used with Prometheus, can benefit greatly from strategic label omission:

1. Streamline Legend Entries: Use PromQL to omit unnecessary labels, resulting in cleaner legends:
    
    ```
    sum by (code) (rate(prometheus_http_requests_total[5m]))
    ```
    
    This query shows request rates by status code, omitting other labels for a concise legend.

### Tips for Creating Clear and Concise Visualizations

When creating visualizations, the goal is to present data in a way that is both easy to understand and actionable. Follow these steps to create clear and concise visualizations:

- Focus on Key Metrics: Highlight the most relevant metrics for your use case, omitting less critical ones.
- Group Data Effectively: Use meaningful labels for grouping, like `region` or `service`, to improve readability.
- Leverage Color Coding: Assign consistent colors for recurring labels across panels to enhance visual clarity.

## FAQs

### What is the difference between 'without' and 'by' clauses in PromQL?

The `without` clause specifies which labels to remove from the result, while the `by` clause specifies which labels to keep. For example:

- `without(label1, label2)` removes `label1` and `label2` from the result.
- `by(label3, label4)` keeps only `label3` and `label4`, removing all other labels.

### Can I permanently remove labels from metrics in Prometheus?

No, you cannot permanently remove labels from metrics stored in Prometheus. Label omission is done at query time and does not affect the underlying stored data. To permanently change labels, you would need to modify the data at the collection point or use relabeling configurations.

### How does label omission affect alerting rules?

Label omission in alerting rules can impact which alerts are fired and how they are grouped. Be cautious when omitting labels in alerting queries to ensure you don't lose the critical context needed for proper alert routing and resolution.

### Are there performance implications when using complex label manipulation in PromQL?

Yes, complex label manipulations can impact query performance, especially on large datasets. Operations like regex-based label selection or extensive use of label join operations may increase query execution time. It's important to balance the need for label manipulation with performance considerations, particularly for frequently executed queries or those used in real-time dashboards.
