Prometheus works by scraping metrics from configured endpoints at specified intervals. These targets include applications, servers, databases, and more. They expose their metrics in a format Prometheus understands. Once Prometheus pulls metrics from these endpounts, it stores them for querying and retrieval when needed.

## How Does Prometheus Work?

The architecture diagram below provides a summary of how Prometheus works as a monitoring tool.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/07/how-does-prometheus-work-Untitled.webp" alt="How Prometheus works" caption="How Prometheus works" />


### The Prometheus Server

Prometheus has a core component called the Prometheus server, which does the main monitoring work. This server is composed of three parts:

1. Time Series Database: This stores the collected metrics data (e.g., CPU usage, request latency) in a highly efficient format optimized for time-based queries.
2. Data Retriever (Scraper): This worker actively pulls metrics from various sources, including applications, databases, servers, and containers. It then sends the collected data to the time series database for storage.
3. HTTP Server API: This provides a way to query the stored metrics data. This API allows users to retrieve and visualize metrics through tools like the Prometheus dashboard, SigNoz, or Grafana.

### Metrics Collection

Prometheus collects metrics by periodically scraping targets. A target is any system or service that exposes metrics via an HTTP endpoint. Each target provides units of monitoring specific to its domain. For instance, in an application, metrics might include request latency or number of exceptions, while for a server, metrics could be CPU usage or memory consumption. These units are known as Metrics.

For Prometheus to pull metrics from a target, the target must expose a specific HTTP endpoint, typically at the `/metrics` path. The HTTP endpoints follow the format; `hostaddress/metrics`. This endpoint provides the current state of the target in a plain text format that Prometheus can understand.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/07/how-does-prometheus-work-Untitled%201.webp" alt="Metrics displayed from an HTTP endpoint (localhost:8080/metrics)" caption="Metrics displayed from an HTTP endpoint (localhost:8080/metrics)" />


### Exporters

While some systems expose Prometheus endpoints by default, others don’t and require an exporter. An exporter is a service that retrieves metrics from targets and transforms them into a format compatible with Prometheus. These converted metrics are then exposed at the exporter's `/metrics` endpoint, where Prometheus can scrape them. 

Prometheus has <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">exporters</a> for different services including MySQL, Elasticssearch, etc. It also provides client libraries for <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">applications</a> that convert metrics data in a Prometheus readable format.

### Scrape Config File

Prometheus has a configuration file, usually named `prometheus.yml` that defines which targets to scrape and how often. For example:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'my-app'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
```

In the above scrape config, Prometheus is set to scrape metrics from an application running on `localhost` at port `8080`, under the job name `my-app`. It will do this every 5 seconds.

### Data Storage

Once metrics are collected, Prometheus stores them in its time-series database (TSDB). This TSDB is optimized for storing and querying time series data efficiently. It handles millions of metrics with ease and stores data in a compressed format to save space.

The data is stored locally, providing fast query performance and reliability. Each metric is stored along with a set of labels, which are key-value pairs that identify the metric's characteristics.

### Data Query

The stored metrics data can be queried when needed for visualization through the Prometheus web UI or a monitoring tool. 

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/07/how-does-prometheus-work-Untitled%202.webp" alt="Prometheus web UI" caption="Prometheus web UI" />


Prometheus provides a powerful query language called PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) to retrieve and manipulate time-series data. PromQL allows users to perform complex queries, aggregations, and transformations on the collected metrics.

Example of a PromQL query:

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/07/how-does-prometheus-work-Untitled%203.webp" alt="PromQL query" caption="PromQL query" />


This query checks the status of targets (Prometheus, node_exporter, cadvisor, or mysqld_exporter) and returns whether they are up (1) or down (0).

### Alerting

For effective monitoring, Prometheus includes a built-in alerting mechanism that allows users to define alerting rules based on PromQL queries. Alerting rules are defined to specify conditions under which alerts should be triggered. These rules evaluate metrics at regular intervals.

For example:

```jsx
groups:
  - name: example-alert
    rules:
       - alert: ContainerKilled
        expr: 'time() - container_last_seen > 60'
        for: 0m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: Container killed (instance {{ $labels.instance }})
          description: "A container has disappeared\n  VALUE = {{ $value }}\n  LABELS = {{ $labels }}"
```

The above alerting rule checks if a container has not been seen in the last 60 seconds and triggers an alert immediately with a warning severity, providing a summary and description with relevant details.

An alert can be in one of three states:

- Inactive: This is the default state of an alert. It means that the condition specified in the alerting rule is not currently met. No actions are taken when an alert is inactive.
- Pending: The is when the condition specified in the alerting rule has been met, but the `for` clause hasn't expired yet. The `for` clause specifies a duration for which the condition must remain true before the alert fires. This acts as a buffer to prevent alerts from triggering due to transient spikes or temporary issues.
- Firing: The alert transitions to this state if the condition specified in the alerting rule remains true for the duration specified in the `for` clause.

*Alerting rules in Prometheus*

Alerts in the firing state are sent out the alert to Alertmanager, which then handles routing the alert to the configured receiver integrations (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty).

### Service Discovery

Prometheus also supports various service discovery mechanisms to find targets automatically. This is particularly useful in dynamic environments like Kubernetes, where services may start and stop frequently. If you also deploy a new application or service in such environments, Prometheus immediately discovers it and starts monitoring it.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/07/how-does-prometheus-work-Untitled%205.webp" alt="Prometheus service discovery" caption="Prometheus service discovery" />



Example of how service discovery is configured for Kubernetes:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'kubernetes-apiservers'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: endpoints
```

Other supported service discovery mechanisms include static configuration, DNS, Consul, Marathon, and more.

## Quick Start with Prometheus

This quick start guide will help you get Prometheus up and running in a few simple steps.

1. Download Prometheus

To download Prometheus on your system, visit the <a href="https://prometheus.io/download/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Prometheus download</a> page. Set your system architecture and identify the appropriate package for your operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows). Click on the download link for the latest stable release.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/07/how-does-prometheus-work-Screenshot_2024-07-12_at_07.23.50.webp" alt="Download Prometheus" caption="Download Prometheus" />



1. Configure `prometheus.yml` file

After downloading Prometheus, extract the tarball downloaded file. You'll find a file named `prometheus.yml` in the extracted directory.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/07/how-does-prometheus-work-Screenshot_2024-07-12_at_07.45.09.webp" alt="Extracted Prometheus folder" caption="Extracted Prometheus folder" />



Prometheus uses a configuration file named `prometheus.yml` to specify which targets to monitor and how to scrape them. Open `prometheus.yml` in a text editor.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/07/how-does-prometheus-work-Screenshot_2024-07-12_at_07.25.29.webp" alt="Prometheus.yml file" caption="Prometheus.yml file" />



In the `prometheus.yml` file, you will see that Prometheus is configured to scrape metrics from itself. You can add other scrape configurations for Prometheus to scrape metrics from different targets on your system.

1. Start Prometheus server

Navigate to the directory where you extracted Prometheus and execute the following command to start Prometheus:

```jsx
./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
```

This command will start Prometheus and use the specified configuration file to determine which targets to scrape.
