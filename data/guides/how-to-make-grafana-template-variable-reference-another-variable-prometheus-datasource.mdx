Dynamic dashboards are essential for teams who rely on scalable monitoring solutions, especially when working with vast datasets. By leveraging chained variables in Grafana, you can make your dashboards adaptable, enabling them to respond to changes in data sources without manual updates. This article walks you through creating powerful Grafana templates with interconnected (chained) variables, specifically using Prometheus as a data source.

## Understanding Grafana Template Variables

Template variables in Grafana allow users to switch between different data views without creating multiple dashboards. They act as placeholders in your Grafana dashboards. This helps users analyze data from multiple sources or viewpoints within a single dashboard setup.

### Different Types of Variables

Grafana supports several types of variables, each serving specific needs:

1. Query Variables
    
    Query variables pull dynamic data directly from a data source, such as Prometheus, to populate options in a dropdown.
    
    Example: A query like `label_values(http_requests_total, job)` will list all the available jobs in Prometheus and let users select from them.
    
2. Custom Variables
    
    Custom variables allow you to define static options manually, which are useful when you have a fixed set of choices.
    
    Example: A custom variable with values like `production`, `staging`, `development` can be used to filter a dashboard based on the selected environment.
    
3. Constant Variables
    
    Constant variables hold a fixed value that remains the same across the entire dashboard, ideal for reusable static information.
    
    Example: A constant variable like `cluster_name: "production-cluster"` can be used throughout the dashboard to reference a specific cluster.
    
4. Datasource Variables
    
    Datasource variables allow you to switch between different data sources dynamically, useful when working with multiple data sources.
    
    Example: A datasource variable can switch between Prometheus and InfluxDB, depending on which source you want to query for the dashboard.
    

### How Variable Chaining Works

Variable chaining in Grafana allows you to create a dynamic relationship between two or more variables, where the options available in one variable depend on the selection made in another. This creates a cascade effect, ensuring that each dropdown filters the next based on the previous selection. This is particularly useful when you have hierarchical or related data, such as selecting a job and then filtering available instances within that job.

How It Works:

1. Parent Variable: The first variable, often called the parent, provides the initial selection options. For example, a "job" variable might list all available jobs in your system.
2. Dependent Variable: The second variable, known as the dependent variable, changes its available options based on the selection made in the parent variable. For example, selecting a specific job can filter the "instance" variable to show only instances related to that job.

Example:

- Job Variable: `job=production`, `job=staging`
- Instance Variable: If `job=production` is selected, the instance variable might show only instances related to the production job, like `instance=prod-server-1`, `prod-server-2`.
- If `job=staging` is selected, the instance dropdown updates to show instances like `staging-server-1`, `staging-server-2`.

In Grafana, variable chaining allows one variable to reference another’s value, creating dynamic filtering for more granular insights. Chained variables are particularly useful in dashboards that monitor multiple systems or environments, enabling them to respond based on selections from other variables.

## Creating Your First Chained Variable with Prometheus

Let’s create a basic setup with Prometheus to see how chained variables work.

1. Set Up the Primary Variable
    - Go to Dashboard Settings > Variables and click Add variable.
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/11/how-to-make-grafana-template-variable-reference-another-variable-prometheus-datasource-image.webp" alt="Adding Variables in dashboards" caption="Adding Variables in dashboards" />
        
    - Select Query as the variable type and choose Prometheus as the data source.

    - In the Query field, use a query like `label_values(job)` to retrieve all available jobs.
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/11/how-to-make-grafana-template-variable-reference-another-variable-prometheus-datasource-image%202.webp" alt="Writing query to populate values in the variable" caption="Writing query to populate values in the variable" />
        
    - Give the variable a name, e.g., `job`, and click on the Apply button.
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/11/how-to-make-grafana-template-variable-reference-another-variable-prometheus-datasource-image%203.webp" alt="Saving the variable" caption="Saving the variable" />
        
2. Configure the Dependent Variable
    - Add a new variable and select Query as the type.
    - Set Prometheus as the data source.
    - In the Query field, use `label_values({job="$job"}, instance)` to populate instances based on the selected `job` value. This example uses `$job` as a reference to the primary variable.
    - Name the variable `instance` and save it.

### Understanding Variable Syntax

Grafana variables use `$variable_name` syntax by default. When using them in more complex expressions, `${variable_name}` syntax can prevent ambiguity in Prometheus queries.

Example: `label_values(metric_name{instance="${instance}"})`.

Best practices for naming and organizing variables

- Use descriptive names (like `job`, `instance`, etc.) for clarity.
- Group related variables together to avoid confusion in large dashboards.

### Variable Reference Patterns

Once you've set up basic variables, you can explore more advanced reference patterns to create more dynamic and context-sensitive queries in Grafana. Here's how to handle both simple and more complex references:

1. Basic and Complex Patterns
    - Single Variable Reference:
        - This is a straightforward way to reference a single variable in your query. For example, `label_values(job)` fetches all available job labels.
        - To filter a second variable based on the first (e.g., `instance` values associated with a selected `job`), you can use `label_values(instance, {job="$job"})`. This ensures that the `instance` variable only shows values for the chosen `job`, allowing you to narrow down your data selection step-by-step.
    - Multiple Dependencies:
        - As dashboards become more complex, you may need to reference more than one variable in a single query. This allows for deeper filtering of data based on multiple criteria.
        - For example, `label_values(metric_name{job="$job", instance="$instance"})` references both `job` and `instance` variables. This query would fetch metric values filtered by both the selected `job` and `instance` values, making the data highly specific to your selections.
2. Using Regex Filters
    
    You can filter values based on patterns with regex:
    
    - For example, using `label_values({job=~"$job_pattern"}, instance)` allows dynamic instance selection based on `job_pattern`.
3. Error Handling and Validation
    
    Sometimes, chained variables can lead to errors if a referenced variable isn’t set or returns no results. To manage this:
    
    - Ensure primary variables have default values.
    - Wrap queries in error-safe PromQL expressions if possible.

## Advanced Variable Chaining Techniques

To enhance your dashboard even further, try these advanced techniques.

### Implement Cascading Dropdowns

Cascading dropdowns in Grafana refer to a set of linked dropdown menus (variables), where the selection made in one dropdown dynamically filters the options available in the next dropdown. This "cascade" effect allows users to narrow down their data choices in a step-by-step manner, ensuring that each dropdown only shows relevant options based on the previous selection.

How Cascading Dropdowns Work:

1. Parent Dropdown: The first dropdown contains a broad set of options (e.g., `job` names in a monitoring system).
2. Dependent Dropdown: The second dropdown shows a set of options that depend on the selection from the first dropdown (e.g., instances related to the selected job).
3. Dynamic Filtering: When you choose a value in the parent dropdown, the dependent dropdown automatically updates to show only the relevant options based on that choice.

Example of Cascading Dropdown:

- Job: The first dropdown lists available jobs (e.g., `job1`, `job2`, etc.).
- Instance: The second dropdown shows instances tied to the selected job (e.g., if you select `job1`, the instance dropdown will show instances related to `job1` only).

This functionality allows for more precise filtering and more efficient data exploration, especially in complex systems where variables have hierarchical relationships.

Steps to set up cascading dropdowns:

1. Define the Parent Variable (e.g., `job`)
    
    Create a variable for `job` that lists all available jobs. This will be the parent dropdown.
    
2. Define the Dependent Variable (e.g., `instance`)
    
    Create a second variable for `instance` with a query that uses the selected `job` value. For example, use `$job` in the query to filter instances based on the chosen job.
    
3. Save Both Variables
    
    After setting up both variables, save the dashboard.
    
4. Test the Cascade
    
    Go to the dashboard view, where you’ll see two dropdowns: one for `job` and one for `instance`.
    
    - Select a `job` in the first dropdown.
    - The `instance` dropdown will automatically update to display only instances associated with the selected job, letting you refine data selections efficiently.

To make use of these variables in a panel, you might use a query like:

```
up{job="$job", instance="$instance"}
```

This query will filter based on both the selected job and instance, displaying data specific to the chosen cascading options.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/11/how-to-make-grafana-template-variable-reference-another-variable-prometheus-datasource-image%206.webp" alt="Displaying data specific to the chosen cascading options." caption="Displaying data specific to the chosen cascading options." />

### Create Dynamic Query Variables

Grafana’s `query` variable type allows you to define a Prometheus query directly as the source, e.g., `label_values(node_cpu, "instance")`. This ensures the list of instances reflects the latest data.

Use Prometheus functions like `label_values(<label>)` and `label_values(<metric>, <label>)` to create dynamic lists based on live metrics. Example: label_values(job) populates based on available labels in Prometheus.

### Multi-Value Selections

Enable multi-value selection for variables, allowing users to select multiple jobs or instances. This is particularly useful when you want to aggregate or compare data across multiple systems.

### Optimizing Variable Performance in Grafana

Optimizing variable performance is essential for creating responsive and efficient dashboards, especially in large-scale or complex environments. Here are strategies to ensure better performance for Grafana variables:

- Enable variable caching in Grafana settings
    
    Enabling caching for variables in Grafana settings helps reduce repeated queries. Cached variables store their results temporarily, which cuts down on the need to re-fetch data every time a dashboard loads, improving speed and responsiveness.
    
- Use the `regex` parameter to filter results
    
    Use the `regex` parameter to retrieve only the data you need, filtering out unnecessary results. By applying regex filters like `/^prod-/`, you can limit variables to production-specific data, which lightens the load and makes queries more efficient.
    
- Limit the number of values in multi-value selections
    
    Multi-value variables are helpful but can slow dashboards when large numbers of selections are made. Restricting the number of selections with a cap or default values prevents excessive data from being queried at once, keeping performance steady.
    
- Use specific metrics instead of high-cardinality ones
    
    High-cardinality metrics (those with many unique label combinations) are resource-intensive. To optimize, use metrics with lower cardinality whenever possible, especially for variables. Aggregated metrics, for instance, can provide valuable insights without the overhead of querying every unique label combination.
