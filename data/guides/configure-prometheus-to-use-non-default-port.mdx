Prometheus, a powerful open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, plays a crucial role in modern DevOps practices. By default, Prometheus operates on port 9090, but there are compelling reasons to change this setting. Whether you're aiming to enhance security, comply with organizational policies, or resolve port conflicts, this guide will walk you through the process of configuring Prometheus to use a non-default port.

## Understanding Prometheus and Default Ports

Prometheus serves as a robust monitoring solution, collecting and storing time series data as metrics. It scrapes metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays results, and can trigger alerts when specified conditions are met.

By default, Prometheus listens on port 9090 for incoming connections. This port is where you access the web interface and where other services connect to scrape metrics. However, using the default port can pose security risks and may conflict with other applications in your infrastructure.

## Why Change Prometheus Port?

Several reasons might prompt you to configure Prometheus to use a non-default port:

1. Security enhancement: Using a non-standard port can reduce exposure to automated scans and potential attacks targeting known default ports.
2. Compliance requirements: Your organization's security policies might mandate the use of specific port ranges for different services.
3. Conflict resolution: Other applications or services in your environment might already use port 9090, necessitating a change for Prometheus.
4. Network segmentation: Custom port configurations can help in logical separation of services within complex network architectures.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Change Prometheus Port

Here’s how you can change the Prometheus port:

### Setting the `-web.listen-address` Flag

Specify the desired port when starting Prometheus. For example, to run Prometheus on port `8080`, use the following commands depending on your setup:

1. Systemd Service

If you're using a systemd service, update the Prometheus service file. Locate it at `/etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service` or a similar path and modify the `ExecStart` line:

```
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
  --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --storage.tsdb.path=/var/lib/prometheus/data \
  --web.listen-address=0.0.0.0:8080
```

Then reload and restart the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
```

1. Docker Container

If you're running Prometheus in Docker, pass the flag as an argument:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  prom/prometheus \
  --web.listen-address=0.0.0.0:8080
```

1. Manual Start

If you're starting Prometheus manually, include the flag:

```bash
prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml --web.listen-address=0.0.0.0:8080
```

### Verifying the Port Change

To ensure the port change was successful:

1. Use `netstat` or `ss` to check the listening port:
    
    ```bash
    sudo netstat -tuln | grep prometheus
    ```
    
2. Access the Prometheus web interface using the new port:
    
    ```
    <http://your-server-ip:8080>
    ```

If you encounter issues, check the Prometheus logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u prometheus -f
```

## Configuring Prometheus Scrape Jobs for Non-Default Ports

When Prometheus or its monitored services operate on non-default ports, you need to adjust the `scrape_configs` section of the `prometheus.yml` file to ensure accurate

1. Open `prometheus.yml` and locate the `scrape_configs` section.
2. Update target ports as needed:
    
    ```yaml
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'node_exporter'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:9100']
      - job_name: 'custom_service'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['service-host:8000']
    ```
    
3. For secured endpoints, add authentication:
    
    ```yaml
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'secure_service'
        scheme: https
        basic_auth:
          username: 'user'
          password: 'password'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['secure-service:8443']
    ```
    

## Impact on Prometheus Ecosystem

Changing Prometheus's default port impacts its integration with other tools and workflows in your monitoring ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of what needs to be updated to ensure continued functionality:

1. Update Grafana: Grafana relies on Prometheus as a data source. After changing the Prometheus port, update the Grafana configuration to point to the new port:
2. Adjust Alertmanager: If Alertmanager is configured to communicate with Prometheus, update its configuration.
3. Review custom scripts: Custom scripts or tools that query Prometheus using its old port need to be updated. These may include:
    - Automation scripts fetching metrics.
    - Applications using Prometheus APIs.
    - CI/CD pipelines with Prometheus integrations.
4. Update documentation: A port change affects everyone using Prometheus. Clear communication and updated documentation are crucial.
