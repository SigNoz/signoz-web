Docker logs are valuable for diagnosing and resolving issues that may arise within your containerized applications and environment. Understanding where these logs are stored and how they can be accessed can help you quickly identify the root cause of errors, track performance trends, and ensure the overall stability of your Docker environment.

Docker container logs are stored in subdirectories under `/var/lib/docker/containers/` on Linux hosts and in `C:\ProgramData\docker\containers` on Windows hosts.

In this article, you will briefly explain about Docker logs and their types, explain where they are located, how to clear them, and how they can be monitored.

## What are Docker Logs?

Docker logs refer to the logs generated by Docker containers and the Docker daemon. These logs are essential for monitoring, debugging, and understanding the behavior of individual containers and the Docker system.

### Types of Docker Logs

There are two different types of logs Docker generates, they include:

1. Container Logs: These logs capture the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) streams produced by the applications running inside a Docker container. They provide valuable insights into the application's behavior, including messages, errors, warnings, and debugging information.
2. Daemon Logs: These logs capture the events and messages generated by the Docker daemon itself, which manages and orchestrates Docker containers. Daemon logs can help diagnose issues with Docker's core functionality, resource usage, and interactions with the host system.

## Where are the Docker Logs Located?

Generally, Docker logs are stored in the below directory:

```bash
/var/lib/docker/
```

Within this directory, the exact location of logs can vary depending on the type of logs and the Docker logging driver in use. Since Docker generates two types of logs, the exact location for each log type will differ:

### Where are Docker Container Logs Stored?

The location where Docker container logs are stored depends on the host operating system.

On Linux Systems

Docker container logs are stored in subdirectories under `/var/lib/docker/containers/` on Linux hosts.

Each container's directory is named after its unique identifier (`<container_id>`) and they each have their own log file; the name of the file is `{container_id}`.log. Docker, by default, uses the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">JSON File logging driver</a>, to store container logs so each log file is in a JSON log format.

Each container has a log specific to their ID (the full ID, not the shortened one that's usually displayed), and you can access it like so:

To access the logs of a container, you will need the complete ID of that container, not the shortened one that's usually displayed when you run `docker ps`. The logs are stored in the below syntax format:

```jsx
/var/lib/docker/containers/ID/ID-json.log
```

To get the full container ID of all running containers, run:

```jsx
docker ps -q --no-trunc
```

To get the container ID of a specific container:

```jsx
docker inspect --format '{{.Id}}' <container-name>
```

Once you have the container ID, you can get the logs from the directory using this command:

```jsx
sudo cat /var/lib/docker/containers/<container-ID>/<container-ID>-json.log
```

For example:

```jsx
sudo cat /var/lib/docker/containers/f1d1369976e6407f6ea1735173fc5044499c22f505145f0ccc46aa8080884d1a/f1d1369976e6407f6ea1735173fc5044499c22f505145f0ccc46aa8080884d1a-json.log
```

The output should look like:

```jsx

```

On Mac Systems

Direct Docker Engine installation is <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">not supported</a> on MacOS. However, you can use Docker on macOS through Docker Desktop.

To access individual Docker container logs on Docker Desktop, from the Docker Desktop UI, select the container of choice and click on the `Logs` section:

<Figure
  src="/img/guides/2024/07/docker-logs-location-docker_container_logs.webp"
  alt="Docker container logs"
  caption="Docker container logs"
/>
<br></br>On Windows Systems

Docker Engine is currently <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">not supported</a> natively on Windows. However, you can use Docker on Windows through Docker Desktop. Depending on your configuration, Docker Desktop leverages either the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) or Hyper-V and sets up a lightweight VM that runs a Linux kernel.

Docker container logs are stored within the file system of this VM and can be accessed via WSL 2 or through the Docker Desktop interface.

The Docker container logs within the VM are typically stored at:

```jsx
\\wsl$\docker-desktop-data\version-pack-data\community\docker\containers\
```

Individual container logs can be accessed at:

```jsx
\\wsl$\docker-desktop-data\version-pack-data\community\docker\containers\[containerID]\[containerID]-json.logs
```

Note: The log path may differ based on your Docker version. Be sure to check your Docker version when accessing the container logs.

### Where are Docker Daemon Logs Stored?

The location where Docker daemon logs are stored depends on the host operating system.

On Linux Systems

On older Docker versions and Linux hosts, Docker daemon logs are located at the `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages` directories. For modern Linux distributions and recent Docker versions, Docker logs are stored in the journal files under `/var/log/journal`. This is because, on most modern Linux distributions using `systemd`, Docker uses the default logging settings, which typically log to the system journal managed by `systemd` (i.e., `journald`).

To identify the location where Docker logs are stored on your Linux system, you need to check the Docker service file. The Docker service file contains configuration details about how the Docker daemon is started and managed. On systems using `systemd`, this file is typically located at `/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`.

To see the Docker service file content:

```jsx
cat / lib / systemd / system / docker.service
```

Look for the `ExecStart` line to see how the Docker daemon is being started.

<Figure
  src="/img/guides/2024/07/docker-logs-location-docker_service.webp"
  alt="Docker service"
  caption="Docker service"
/>
<br></br>From the above screenshot, the `ExecStart` line in the Docker service unit file,
specifically `/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock`, indicates
that Docker is set up to use socket activation with `systemd`. In this setup, the Docker daemon
communicates with `systemd` via the file descriptor passed (`fd://`), and `systemd` handles the
activation and monitoring of the Docker service.

As a result, logs generated by the Docker daemon are directed to `systemd's` journald. Journal files are typically binary and not designed for direct human readability. To effectively view the Docker daemon logs captured by `journald`, use the command:

```jsx
journalctl -xu docker.service
```

`journalctl` is a command-line utility for querying and displaying log entries from the systemd journal. The journal is a structured log that stores information about system events, service starts/stops, and errors.

The above command displays and filters the `systemd` journal logs for messages related to the Docker service, including errors.

<Figure
  src="/img/guides/2024/07/docker-logs-location-journal_docker_service.webp"
  alt="Docker daemon logs"
  caption="Docker daemon logs"
/>
<br></br>On Mac Systems

On macOS, the Docker Engine itself is not directly supported. However, you can use Docker Engine on macOS through Docker Desktop.

The Docker daemon logs, tagged as <a href="https://www.notion.so/Docker-Logs-Location-8e305679af0d4c82a93c245f1fdb39c2?pvs=21" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">dockerd</a> on macOS, are stored at:

```jsx
~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/log/vm/dockerd.log
```

This log file captures events and messages related to the Docker daemon (`dockerd`) running inside the Docker virtual machine (VM) managed by Docker Desktop. It includes information about Docker engine operations, such as container lifecycle events (like creation, start, stop, removal), network configuration, storage management, and general Docker daemon activities.

For logs specific to the `containerd` runtime, which is responsible for managing container lifecycle operations and their runtime environments, they are stored at:

```jsx
~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/log/vm/containerd.log
```

This log file includes detailed information about container runtime events, execution events (like starts and exits), image management, and lower-level container operations.

On Windows Systems

Docker daemon (dockerd) logs are stored within the filesystem of the WSL2 VM that Docker Desktop uses:

```jsx
 %LOCALAPPDATA%\Docker\log\vm\dockerd.log
```

If you are interested in the container runtime, `containerd` logs, they are also stored within the WSL2 VM filesystem at:

```jsx
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Docker\log\vm\containerd.log
```

## How to Clear the Docker Log File

Docker logs files can be cleared based on how Docker was installed. To clear the Docker log file on Linux systems, first stop Docker:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop docker
```

Navigate to the directory where the Docker log file is located and use `journalctl` to clear the logs related to the Docker service:

```jsx
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1s --unit=docker.service
```

This command deletes any archived systemd journal logs related to the Docker service that are older than one second. It ensures that only the logs from the Docker service are cleared, leaving other system logs intact.

<Figure
  src="/img/guides/2024/07/docker-logs-location-vacuum_command.webp"
  alt="Cleared Docker logs"
  caption="Cleared Docker logs"
/>
<br></br>Note: Docker continuously generates new logs as containers are started, stopped, or
interacted with. Clearing logs with `journalctl` only removes archived logs, not the active ones
currently in memory. Once the logs are cleared, restart the Docker service to resume normal
operation:

```jsx
sudo systemctl start docker
```

## Monitor and Analyze Docker Logs in SigNoz

Monitoring and analyzing Docker logs directly in the terminal is not very efficient or scalable, especially as your application grows in complexity and the volume of logs increases. For advanced log management and analysis, it is best to forward the logs to a log management tool like [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/).

SigNoz is an open-source observability platform that offers comprehensive log management capabilities.

SigNoz uses a columnar database, ClickHouse, to store logs. This database is very efficient at ingesting and storing log data and making it available for analysis. It also uses <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry</a> for instrumenting applications. OpenTelemetry, backed by <a href="https://www.cncf.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CNCF</a>, is quickly becoming the world standard for instrumenting cloud-native applications.

The logs tab in SigNoz has advanced features like a log query builder, search across multiple fields, structured table view, JSON view, etc.

<Figure

/>

You can also view logs in real time with live tail logging.

<Figure
  src="/img/guides/2024/07/docker-logs-location-Untitled%201.webp"
  alt="Untitled"
  caption="SigNoz Dashboard"
/>

With the advanced Log Query Builder, you can filter out logs quickly by mixing and matching fields.

## FAQs

### Where can I find docker logs?

Docker logs are typically found in `/var/lib/docker/containers` on Linux and `C:\ProgramData\docker\containers` on Windows.

### Where does a container store logs?

Containers don't store logs persistently; they output to stdout and stderr, which are managed by the Docker daemon.

### Where are old docker logs?

Old logs may be rotated or removed depending on the logging driver configuration.

### How to check docker logs live?

Use `docker logs -f <container-name>` or `docker logs -f <container-id>`.

### Where is the docker login stored?

Docker login credentials are stored in `~/.docker/config.json` file on Linux and `%USERPROFILE%\.docker\config.json` on Windows.

### How to check docker-compose logs?

Use `docker-compose logs` to check logs of all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Where is a docker container stored?

Containers aren't "stored" as single files; their data exists in layers within the Docker image and runtime environment.

### What are logs in storage?

Logs in storage refer to log files generated by Docker containers stored locally on the host filesystem.

### How to reduce docker logs?

To reduce Docker logs, configure log rotation in Docker settings or with logging drivers like `json-file` using `max-size` and `max-file` options.
