Grafana, a popular open-source platform for monitoring and visualization, sometimes needs to be removed from your system. Whether you're troubleshooting issues, upgrading to a new version, or simply cleaning up your system, knowing how to uninstall Grafana completely is crucial. This guide walks you through the process of removing Grafana from various operating systems, ensuring no leftover files or configurations remain.

## What is Grafana and Why Uninstall It?

Grafana is an open-source analytics and monitoring solution that allows you to query, visualize, and alert on metrics from various data sources. Despite its usefulness, there are several reasons you might need to uninstall it:

- System cleanup: Removing unused applications to free up space
- Version conflicts: Preparing for a clean installation of a different version
- Switching to alternatives: Moving to a different monitoring solution
- Troubleshooting: Resolving issues by performing a clean installation

Proper uninstallation is important to avoid leftover files and configurations that can cause conflicts or take up unnecessary space. The uninstallation process varies across different operating systems but generally involves stopping the service, removing packages, and deleting associated files and directories.

## Quick Guide: Uninstalling Grafana in 5 Steps

If you're in a hurry, here’s a quick overview of the uninstallation process:

1. Stop the Grafana service: Ensure Grafana is not running before uninstalling.
2. Remove Grafana packages and dependencies: Use your system's package manager to uninstall the Grafana package.
3. Delete Grafana configuration files: Manually delete configuration directories.
4. Remove the Grafana repository (if applicable): Clean up any package repository files.
5. Verify complete removal: Ensure no processes, files, or services remain related to Grafana.

While these steps provide a general outline, the specific commands and procedures vary depending on your operating system. Let's dive into the details for each major platform.

## How to Uninstall Grafana on Ubuntu and Debian-based Systems

Uninstalling Grafana on Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems involves using the package manager and manually removing some files. Follow these steps:

1. Stopping the Grafana Service

Before uninstalling Grafana, stop the service to ensure no running processes:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop grafana-server
```

2. Removing Grafana and Its Dependencies

To remove Grafana and its associated packages, use `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove --purge grafana
```

Note: The `--purge` option ensures that configuration files managed by the package system are removed, but it won't touch manually added files or plugins in custom directories

If you also want to remove unnecessary dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get autoremove
```

3. Deleting the Grafana Repository

If you installed Grafana via a repository, remove the repository reference:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
sudo apt-get update
```

4. Removing Grafana User and Group

Grafana creates a user and group during installation. You can delete them by running:

```bash
sudo deluser --remove-home grafana
sudo delgroup grafana
```

You might need `--system` with delgroup if Grafana created a system-level group.

5. Manually Deleting Remaining Files and Directories

Finally, remove any remaining files:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/grafana /etc/grafana /var/log/grafana
```

### Dealing with Custom Installations

If you’ve installed Grafana in non-standard directories or manually added plugins, locate the relevant files and remove them:

```bash
sudo find / -name grafana
```

Backup any important data before deletion.

## Uninstalling Grafana on Red Hat and CentOS Systems

For Red Hat-based systems, including CentOS, follow these steps to uninstall Grafana:

1. Stop the Grafana service:
    
    ```
    sudo systemctl stop grafana-server
    ```
    
2. Remove Grafana packages:
    
    ```
    # For systems using dnf
    sudo dnf remove -y grafana
    
    # For systems using yum
    sudo yum remove -y grafana
    ```
    
3. Delete Grafana repository files:
    
    ```
    sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/grafana.repo
    ```
    
4. Clean up remaining configuration files and logs:
    
    ```
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/grafana
    sudo rm -rf /var/log/grafana
    sudo rm -rf /etc/grafana
    ```
    
5. Verify uninstallation using rpm queries:
    
    ```
    rpm -qa | grep grafana
    ```
    
    If the command returns no output, it indicates that Grafana has been successfully uninstalled. If it returns any lines, those packages are still installed.

## Uninstalling Grafana on macOS

For macOS users, the uninstallation process depends on how Grafana was installed. If you used Homebrew, follow these steps:

1. Stop the Grafana service:
    
    ```
    brew services stop grafana
    ```
    
    For non-Homebrew installations, you can stop the service with `launchctl` :
    
    ```sql
    launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.grafana.grafana.plist
    ```
    
2. Uninstall Grafana using Homebrew:
    
    ```
    brew uninstall grafana
    ```
    
3. Manually remove Grafana files and directories:
    
    ```
    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/var/lib/grafana
    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/var/log/grafana
    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/etc/grafana
    ```
    
    Note: The actual installation paths might vary depending on the user's configuration. 
    
    With Homebrew installation, you are likely to find them at the following paths:
    
    ```sql
    /opt/homebrew/etc/grafana
    /opt/homebrew/var/lib/grafana/
    /opt/homebrew/var/log/grafana/
    ```
    
4. Grafana, like many other applications on macOS, stores user preferences, configuration files, and support files in the Application Support directory. 
    
    To remove them run the command:
    
    ```
    rm -rf ~/Library/Application Support/Grafana
    ```
    
5. Verify complete removal using the find command:
    
    ```
    sudo find / -name "*grafana*"
    ```
    

## Post-Uninstallation Steps and Verification

After uninstalling Grafana, take these additional steps to ensure a complete removal:

1. Check for remaining processes:
    
    ```
    # On Unix-based systems
    ps aux | grep grafana
    
    # On Windows (PowerShell)
    Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*grafana*"}
    ```
    
2. Verify the removal of all Grafana-related files and directories:
    
    ```
    # On Unix-based systems
    sudo find / -name "*grafana*"
    
    # On Windows (PowerShell)
    Get-ChildItem -Path C:\\ -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*grafana*"}
    ```
    
3. Clean up environment variables and system paths:
    - Check your system's environment variables for any Grafana-related entries
    - Remove Grafana paths from your system's PATH variable if present
4. Reboot your system to ensure complete removal and clear any lingering processes or cached data.
5. If you plan to reinstall Grafana, test with a fresh installation to confirm the previous version was completely removed.

## Alternatives to Complete Uninstallation

In some cases, you might not need to completely uninstall Grafana. Consider these alternatives:

- Temporarily disable the Grafana service:
    
    ```
    sudo systemctl stop grafana-server
    sudo systemctl disable grafana-server
    ```
    
- If you installed Grafana using Docker, then you can use the following commands for easier management and removal:
    
    ```
    docker stop grafana
    docker rm grafana
    ```
    
- Archive Grafana data for future reference:
    
    ```
    tar -czf grafana_backup.tar.gz /var/lib/grafana
    ```
    
- Downgrade the Grafana version instead of complete removal:
    
    ```
    sudo apt-get install grafana=<previous_version>
    ```
