Monitoring containerized environments effectively is crucial for debugging, capacity planning, and maintaining uptime. In this guide, we'll walk through a hands-on setup of Prometheus and Grafana entirely on Docker, ideal for local development, POCs, or staging environments, no Kubernetes required.

## Why Use Docker for Prometheus and Grafana?

Docker simplifies and secures the deployment of Prometheus and Grafana with these key benefits:

1. **Isolation & Security**
    
    Containers provide process isolation via namespaces and cgroups. Combined with Docker's security features like seccomp and read-only filesystems, this reduces risk and surface area for attacks.
    
2. **Persistent Storage**
    
    Docker volumes retain Prometheus TSDB data and Grafana configs across restarts, ensuring observability data isn‚Äôt lost during container lifecycle events.
    
3. **Network Control**
    
    Docker networks (bridge, overlay) enable secure, isolated communication. Port mapping and firewall rules limit external exposure (e.g., 9090, 3000), enhancing security.
    
4. **Environment Consistency**
    
    Docker guarantees consistent behavior across dev, staging, and prod, eliminating environment drift and simplifying debugging.
    

## Prerequisites for Installing Prometheus and Grafana on Docker

Before setting up, ensure the following prerequisites are met to avoid compatibility or runtime issues:

- **Docker ‚â• 20.10 and Docker Compose ‚â• 1.29** installed. <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Install Docker</a> | <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Install Compose</a>
- **System resources**: Minimum 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM, and 2 GB of free disk space.
- **Open ports**: Ensure default ports ‚Äî 9090 (Prometheus), 3000 (Grafana), and optionally 8080 (cAdvisor) ‚Äî are available, unless you've configured these services to use different ports.
- **Administrative privileges**: `sudo` or root access to install Docker and manage containers.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Install Prometheus on Docker

Prometheus is a robust monitoring and alerting system, and Docker makes it easy to deploy and manage. Follow these steps to containerize Prometheus using Docker Compose.

1. **Create a Dedicated Docker Network**
    
    Create a user-defined bridge network for Prometheus and Grafana to enable container-to-container communication without exposing internal ports externally.
    
    ```jsx
    docker network create monitoring
    ```
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2025/06/how-to-install-prometheus-and-grafana-on-docker-image.webp" alt="command: docker network ls" caption="command: docker network ls" />
    
2. **Create a Prometheus Configuration File**
    
    Define scrape settings and specify the Prometheus server itself as a target in a file named `prometheus.yml`:
    
    ```
    global:
      scrape_interval: 15s  # Frequency of metric scraping
    
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'prometheus'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:9090']
    ```
    
    üìå *This configuration tells Prometheus to scrape metrics from itself every 15 seconds.*
    
3. **Create a Docker Compose File**
    
    Define the Prometheus container setup in `docker-compose.yml`. Pin the image version for stability and map the configuration file as a volume.
    
    ```jsx
    version: '3.8'
    
    services:
      prometheus:
        image: prom/prometheus:v2.52.0
        container_name: prometheus
        ports:
          - "9090:9090"
        volumes:
          - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
        networks:
          - monitoring
        restart: unless-stopped
    
    networks:
      monitoring:
        external: true
    ```
    
    üìù *Using `restart: unless-stopped` ensures Prometheus restarts automatically if it crashes or the system reboots.*
    
4. **Launch Prometheus**
    
    Start the service in detached mode:
    
    ```jsx
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    
5. **Verify Prometheus is Running**
    
    Check if the container is active:
    
    ```
    docker ps
    ```
    
    You should see the `prometheus` container listed and listening on port `9090`.
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2025/06/how-to-install-prometheus-and-grafana-on-docker-image%201.webp" alt="command: docker ps" caption="command: docker ps" />
    
6. **Access the Prometheus UI**

Navigate to `http://localhost:9090` in your browser. You should see the Prometheus web interface.

### Troubleshooting

If Prometheus doesn't start:

- Check logs:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs prometheus
    ```
    
- Ensure the config file path and syntax are correct.
- Confirm port `9090` is not in use.

## Configuring Prometheus for Metric Collection

To monitor your services, Prometheus must know where to pull metrics from. This is done by defining scrape jobs in the configuration file.

1. **Add a New Scrape Job to `prometheus.yml`**
    
    Each job in Prometheus represents a set of targets that expose metrics. Update your configuration file to include your app:
    
    ```yaml
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'my-app'  # Descriptive name for the service
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['app-host:8000']  # Replace with container name or IP and port
    ```
    
    üìå *Ensure `app-host` is resolvable from within the Prometheus container‚Äîuse a Docker service name or internal container name if they're on the same network.*
    
    üí° *You can also customize the scrape interval per job:*
    
    ```yaml
    scrape_interval: 10s
    scrape_timeout: 5s
    ```
    
2. **Restart Prometheus to Apply the New Configuration**
    
    Use Docker Compose to reload the updated configuration:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose restart prometheus
    ```
    
    üîç *Alternatively, use `docker exec` to test the config before restarting:*
    
    ```bash
    docker exec -it prometheus promtool check config /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ```
    
3. **Verify Metric Collection in the Prometheus UI**
    - Open: <a href="http://localhost:9090/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://localhost:9090</a>
    - Go to **Status ‚Üí Targets** to ensure your new job appears and is marked as **UP**
    - Use the **Graph** tab to query example metrics, such as:
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2025/06/how-to-install-prometheus-and-grafana-on-docker-image%202.webp" alt="Prometheus graph using PromQL Query" caption="Prometheus graph using PromQL Query" />
        

## Installing Grafana on Docker

Grafana is a powerful visualization tool that complements Prometheus by turning raw metrics into insightful dashboards. By containerizing Grafana with Docker, you can easily manage, deploy, and persist your monitoring setup alongside Prometheus.

1. **Update Your `docker-compose.yml` to Include Grafana**
    
    Update your Docker Compose file to include Grafana as a service. This setup ensures persistent storage, environment configuration, and seamless integration with your monitoring network:
    
    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'
    
    services:
      prometheus:
        image: prom/prometheus:v2.52.0
        # ... existing Prometheus config
    
      grafana:
        image: grafana/grafana:10.2.2
        container_name: grafana
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
        environment:
          - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password
        volumes:
          - grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana
        networks:
          - monitoring
        restart: unless-stopped
    
    volumes:
      grafana-storage:
    
    networks:
      monitoring:
        external: true
    ```
    
    üìå *Using a named volume ensures Grafana persists dashboards and data sources across container restarts.*
    
2. **Launch Grafana**
    
    Run the following command to bring up the updated stack:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    
    <Figure src="/img/guides/2025/06/how-to-install-prometheus-and-grafana-on-docker-image%203.webp" alt="Command: docker-compose up -d" caption="Command: docker-compose up -d" />
    
    Once running, access the web interface at:
    
    ‚û°Ô∏è <a href="http://localhost:3000/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">**http://localhost:3000**</a>
    

## Connecting Grafana to Prometheus

To visualize Prometheus metrics effectively in Grafana, the first step is to establish a connection between the two. This involves configuring Prometheus as a data source and building a dashboard to display meaningful insights.

1. **Set up Prometheus as a Data Source in Grafana**
    - Navigate to Connections ‚Üí Data Sources ‚Üí Add data source in the left side panel.
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2025/06/how-to-install-prometheus-and-grafana-on-docker-image%204.webp" alt="Adding a data source in Grafana" caption="Adding a data source in Grafana" />
        
    - Enter the **Prometheus server URL** in the configuration field.
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2025/06/how-to-install-prometheus-and-grafana-on-docker-image%205.webp" alt="Enter Prometheus server URL in the config field" caption="Enter Prometheus server URL in the config field" />
        
    - Configure authentication settings (if required).
    - Click "**Save & Test**" to verify the connection
2. **Create a New Dashboard and Panel**
    - Navigate to **Dashboards** ‚Üí **New Dashboard** ‚Üí Click on the **Add Visualization** button
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2025/06/how-to-install-prometheus-and-grafana-on-docker-image%206.webp" alt="Create a new dashboard and add a visualization" caption="Create a new dashboard and add a visualization" />
        
    - Select **Prometheus** from the data source dropdown
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2025/06/how-to-install-prometheus-and-grafana-on-docker-image%207.webp" alt="Select Prometheus as the data source" caption="Select Prometheus as the data source" />
        
    - Choose the appropriate visualization type
3. **Input Your PromQL Expression**
    - In the query editor, enter your metric division expression. For example, to calculate CPU usage for each core:
        
        ```
        100 - (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m]) * 100
        ```
        
        This query breaks down CPU usage for each core individually, showing how much time each core is spending on active tasks over a 5-minute interval.
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2025/06/how-to-install-prometheus-and-grafana-on-docker-image_(6).webp" alt="PromQL expression for CPU usage" caption="PromQL expression for CPU usage" />
        

## Monitoring Docker with cAdvisor

While Prometheus is excellent at scraping and storing metrics, it needs exporters to expose metrics from different systems. **cAdvisor (Container Advisor)** is a lightweight exporter developed by Google that collects real-time resource usage and performance metrics directly from Docker containers. It provides detailed insights such as:

- CPU and memory usage
- Network I/O
- Filesystem utilization
- Container lifecycle stats

This makes cAdvisor an essential tool for gaining **container-level observability**, especially when you're working with microservices or multiple Docker containers.

1. **Add cAdvisor to Your `docker-compose.yml`:**
    
    Add the following service to your existing Docker Compose setup:
    
    ```yaml
    cadvisor:
        image: gcr.io/cadvisor/cadvisor:v0.47.2
        container_name: cadvisor
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
        volumes:
          - /:/rootfs:ro
          - /var/run:/var/run:ro
          - /sys:/sys:ro
          - /var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro
          - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro  # Only needed on Docker Desktop for Mac
        networks:
          - monitoring
        restart: unless-stopped
    
    ```
    
    üìù *cAdvisor provides insights like memory, CPU, and network usage for each container.*
    
2. **Update `prometheus.yml` to Scrape cAdvisor**
    
    Now that cAdvisor is part of your stack, configure Prometheus to collect metrics from it:
    
    ```yaml
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'cadvisor'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['cadvisor:8080']
    ```
    
3. **Restart the Stack**
    
    Apply your changes and restart the Docker stack:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    
    Once it's up and running, you‚Äôll start seeing per-container metrics in Prometheus and can visualize them in Grafana for deeper analysis.
    

## Best Practices and Optimization

To maximize performance, reliability, and security in your monitoring setup:

- **Secure your stack**:
    - Enable authentication for both Prometheus and Grafana.
    - Serve both tools behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS (e.g., Nginx + Let's Encrypt).
    - Use network policies or firewalls to restrict access to monitoring ports.
- **Optimize storage**:
    - Configure Prometheus's `-storage.tsdb.retention.time` to limit historical data retention based on your storage capacity.
    - Regularly clean up unused dashboards or data sources in Grafana.
- **Alert proactively**:
    - Define alerting rules in Prometheus and route them using Alertmanager.
    - Integrate alerts with tools like Slack, PagerDuty, or email.
    - Use Grafana's alerting engine for panel-based threshold alerts.
- **Maintain your stack**:
    - Pin image versions to avoid unexpected changes (`grafana/grafana:10.2.2`, `prom/prometheus:v2.52.0`).
    - Monitor Prometheus's own metrics (e.g., `prometheus_tsdb_head_series`) to detect performance bottlenecks.
    - Backup volumes (`prometheus-data`, `grafana-storage`) regularly.

## Key Takeaways

- Prometheus and Grafana on Docker provide a flexible and powerful monitoring solution.
- Proper configuration is crucial for effective metric collection and visualization.
- Regular maintenance ensures long-term performance and reliability.
