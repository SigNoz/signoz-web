Performance monitoring is crucial for maintaining robust Java applications. Enter Codahale Metrics — a powerful library that simplifies the process of gathering and reporting performance data. At the heart of this toolkit lies the @Timed annotation, a simple yet effective way to measure method execution times. This article delves into the intricacies of using @Timed metrics in plain Java, providing the knowledge to enhance your application's observability.

## Understanding Codahale Metrics and @Timed Annotation

Codahale Metrics, which is now maintained as part of Dropwizard Metrics, is a Java library designed to capture and report various application metrics. It offers a suite of annotations and classes that make performance monitoring a breeze.

<a href="https://www.dropwizard.io/en/stable/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Dropwizard</a> is a framework built to provide production-ready features, such as application metrics, health checks, and configuration management, making it a robust solution for modern Java applications.

The @Timed annotation is a key component of this library. When applied to a method, it automatically tracks:

- The number of times the method is called
- The total time spent executing the method
- The distribution of execution times

Here's why @Timed is invaluable for performance monitoring:

1. Minimal overhead: It adds negligible performance impact to your application.
2. Automatic tracking: No need to manually instrument your code for timing.
3. Statistical insights: Provides mean, median, and percentile data for method execution times.

Compared to other metric annotations:

- @Metered: Focuses on throughput (calls per second)
- @ExceptionMetered: Tracks the rate of exceptions thrown

@Timed offers a more comprehensive view of method performance, making it the go-to choice for general-purpose timing metrics.

### Integrating `@Timed` with Metric Reporting Systems

The true power of Codahale Metrics is in its ability to integrate with a variety of metric reporting systems, allowing you to visualize, log, and analyze these metrics in real time or periodically. Here's how `@Timed` metrics can be integrated with some popular reporting systems:

1. JMX (Java Management Extensions):
JMX is a built-in feature for monitoring Java applications. By exposing metrics through JMX, you can track method timings via tools like JConsole or VisualVM.
    
    ```java
    JmxReporter reporter = JmxReporter.forRegistry(metricRegistry).build();
    reporter.start();
    ```
    
2. SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java):
`@Timed` can integrate with SLF4J, allowing you to print timing data to your application logs at a specified interval.
    
    ```java
    Slf4jReporter reporter = Slf4jReporter.forRegistry(metricRegistry)
        .outputTo(LoggerFactory.getLogger("metrics"))
        .build();
    reporter.start(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
    ```
    
3. Graphite:
For those looking to visualize metrics over time, Graphite is a popular choice. The `GraphiteReporter` class allows you to send timing metrics (collected via `@Timed`) to a Graphite server.
    
    ```java
    final Graphite graphite = new Graphite(new InetSocketAddress("graphite.example.com", 2003));
    final GraphiteReporter reporter = GraphiteReporter.forRegistry(metricRegistry)
        .prefixedWith("myApp")
        .build(graphite);
    reporter.start(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
    ```
    

## Implementing Timer in Plain Java

### Add the Codahale Metrics Dependency

To use Codahale Metrics in your project, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` if you are using Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.dropwizard.metrics</groupId>
    <artifactId>metrics-core</artifactId>
    <version>4.2.8</version>
</dependency>

```

### Create a `MetricRegistry` Instance

First, initialize a `MetricRegistry` instance to manage your metrics:

```java
MetricRegistry metricRegistry = new MetricRegistry();
```

### Using `Timer` to Measure Method Execution Time

You can manually create and use a `Timer` to track the duration of method executions. Here’s how you can implement it:

```java
package sample;

import com.codahale.metrics.*;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class TimerExample {
    static final MetricRegistry metrics = new MetricRegistry();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        startReport();

        Timer timer = metrics.timer("processTime");
        Timer.Context context = timer.time();

        try {
            performTask();
        } finally {
		        // Stop the timer
            context.stop();  
        }

        wait5Seconds();
    }

    static void startReport() {
        ConsoleReporter reporter = ConsoleReporter.forRegistry(metrics)
            .convertRatesTo(TimeUnit.SECONDS)
            .convertDurationsTo(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
            .build();
        reporter.start(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    }

    static void performTask() {
        // Simulate some work with a sleep
        try {
		        // Simulate task taking 2 seconds
            Thread.sleep(2000);  
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }

    static void wait5Seconds() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5 * 1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

```

The above code returns the output as follows:

### Configuring the MetricRegistry

The MetricRegistry is the central component that manages all your metrics. Here's how to set it up and use it effectively:

1. Create a singleton MetricRegistry:
Making the `MetricRegistry` a singleton ensures that all metrics are centralized and consistent across your application. This design prevents multiple instances of the registry from existing, which could lead to fragmented or inaccurate metrics.
    
    ```java
    public class MetricRegistryHolder {
        private static final MetricRegistry REGISTRY = new MetricRegistry();
    
        public static MetricRegistry getRegistry() {
            return REGISTRY;
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
2. Register metrics programmatically (useful for dynamic metrics):
    
    ```java
    Timer timer = MetricRegistryHolder.getRegistry().timer("processTime");
    
    ```
    
3. Integrate with reporting systems:
    
    ```java
    ConsoleReporter reporter = ConsoleReporter.forRegistry(MetricRegistryHolder.getRegistry())
        .convertRatesTo(TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .convertDurationsTo(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
        .build();
    reporter.start(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
    ```
    

This setup prints metrics to the console every minute. Consider JMX, Graphite, or other more robust reporting options for production use.

</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.glassfish.jersey.containers</groupId>
    <artifactId>jersey-container-servlet</artifactId>
    <version>2.34</version>
</dependency>

```

1. Project Setup:

Create a new Spring Boot project. Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file:
Maven setup (pom.xml):

```java
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.dropwizard.metrics</groupId>
    <artifactId>metrics-core</artifactId>
    <version>4.2.8</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle setup (build.gradle):

```
gradle
Copy code
implementation 'io.dropwizard.metrics:metrics-core:4.2.8'

```

2. AOP Configuration:

Configure AOP in your Spring Boot application. Here's an example using Spring AOP:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
public class MetricsConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public MetricRegistry metricRegistry() {
        return new MetricRegistry();
    }

    @Bean
    public TimedAspect timedAspect(MetricRegistry metricRegistry) {
        return new TimedAspect(metricRegistry);
    }
}
```

3. Aspect Implementation:

Create an aspect class to intercept methods annotated with `@Timed`:

```java
@Aspect
public class TimedAspect {

    private final MetricRegistry metricRegistry;

    @Autowired
    public TimedAspect(MetricRegistry metricRegistry) {
        this.metricRegistry = metricRegistry;
    }

    @Around("@annotation(com.codahale.metrics.annotation.Timed)")
    public Object timed(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
        String metricName = getMetricName(joinPoint);
        Timer timer = metricRegistry.timer(metricName);
        Timer.Context context = timer.time();
        try {
            return joinPoint.proceed();
        } finally {
            context.stop();
        }
    }

    private String getMetricName(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) {
        // Implement your logic to determine the metric name based on the join point
        return joinPoint.getTarget().getClass().getSimpleName() + "." + joinPoint.getSignature().getName();
    }
}
```

4. Using the @Timed Annotation:

Annotate your methods with `@Timed` to enable automatic timing:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    @Timed(name = "myService.myMethod")
    public void myMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

1. Testing Metrics with @Timed
Unit tests can be written to verify that the `@Timed` annotation is properly capturing metrics. This can be done by asserting the number of times a method has been called and the time taken.
    
    ```java
    @RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
    @SpringBootTest
    public class MyServiceTest {
    	@Autowired
    	private MetricRegistry metricRegistry;
    	
    	@Autowired
    	private MyService myService;
    	
    	@Test
    	public void testTimedAnnotation() {
    	    Timer timer = metricRegistry.timer("myService.myMethod");
    	
    	    // Call the method
    	    myService.myMethod();
    	
    	    // Assert that the method was timed
    	    assertEquals(1, timer.getCount());
    	
    	    // Optionally, check that the timing is within a reasonable range
    	    assertTrue(timer.getSnapshot().getMean() > 0);
    	}
    }
    ```
    
    This test ensures that the `@Timed` annotation is functioning correctly, capturing the execution time and invocation count of the annotated method.
    

## Advanced Usage of @Timed Metrics

To truly master @Timed metrics, explore these advanced techniques:

1. Customize metric names and descriptions:
    
    ```java
    @Timed(name = "processOrder", absolute = true, description = "Time taken to process an order")
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        // Method implementation
    }
    ```
    
    The `absolute = true` flag in the `@Timed` annotation ensures the metric name is used exactly as provided, without including the class name as a prefix. This is helpful when you want concise, globally unique metric names, especially in large applications
    
2. Apply @Timed to abstract classes:
    
    ```java
    public abstract class BaseService {
        @Timed(name = "baseOperation")
        public abstract void performOperation();
    }
    
    ```
    
    Concrete implementations will inherit this timed metric.
    
3. Use @Timed with RESTful services:
    
    ```java
    @Path("/users")
    public class UserResource {
        @GET
        @Path("/{id}")
        @Timed(name = "getUserById")
        public Response getUserById(@PathParam("id") String id) {
            // Method implementation
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
4. Combine @Timed with other metric types:
    
    ```java
    public class OrderService {
        @Timed
        @Metered(name = "orderProcessingRate")
        @ExceptionMetered(name = "orderProcessingExceptions")
        public void processOrder(Order order) {
            // Method implementation
        }
    }
    
    ```
    

This approach provides a comprehensive view of the method's performance, throughput, and error rate.

## Analyzing and Interpreting @Timed Metrics

@Timed metrics offer a wealth of data. Here's how to make sense of it:

1. Key performance indicators:
    - Mean execution time: Average performance
    - 95th percentile: Insight into worst-case scenarios
    - Throughput: Calls per second
2. Visualization techniques:
    - Histograms: Display distribution of execution times
    - Time-series graphs: Show performance trends over time
3. Making data-driven decisions:
    - Identify performance bottlenecks by comparing @Timed metrics across different methods
    - Set performance budgets based on 95th-percentile execution times
    - Trigger alerts when execution times exceed predefined thresholds

## FAQs

### How does @Timed differ from manual timing implementations?

@Timed provides automatic, consistent timing with minimal code changes. It offers statistical aggregation out-of-the-box, reducing the risk of errors in manual timing logic.

### Can @Timed be used in multi-threaded environments?

Yes, @Timed is thread-safe. It uses atomic operations to update metrics, ensuring accurate timing in concurrent scenarios.

### What's the performance overhead of using @Timed annotations?

The overhead is typically negligible — usually less than a microsecond per invocation. However, sampling should be considered to reduce the impact in extremely high-throughput situations.

### How can I exclude certain @Timed metrics from being reported?

You can implement a custom MetricFilter when creating your reporter:

```java
MetricFilter filter = (name, metric) -> !name.startsWith("excluded");
ConsoleReporter reporter = ConsoleReporter.forRegistry(registry)
    .filter(filter)
    .build();

```

This example excludes all metrics whose names start with "excluded".
