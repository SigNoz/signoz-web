The landscape of IT operations and system management is evolving rapidly. As systems become more complex, the need for comprehensive insights grows. Three key concepts — observability, monitoring, and telemetry — play crucial roles in modern IT environments. But what exactly are these concepts, and how do they differ? This article breaks down the distinctions and explores their interconnected roles in maintaining robust, efficient systems.

## Quick Guide: Understanding the Trio

Before diving into the details, let's establish a quick overview of these three concepts:

- Observability: The ability of a system to provide deep insights into its internal state, often focusing on unknown issues.
- Monitoring: Actively tracking predefined metrics and thresholds to ensure system health.
- Telemetry: The process of collecting and transmitting data from remote or inaccessible sources.

These concepts work together in modern IT environments to comprehensively view system performance and health. Telemetry feeds data to monitoring and observability tools, which then analyze this information to provide actionable insights.

In the following sections, you will learn about the various aspects of these concepts in detail. So, let’s start right away.

## What is Observability?

Observability originates from control theory in engineering. It refers to how well you can understand a system's internal states from its external outputs. Observability provides insights into complex, distributed systems in IT, often revealing unknown issues or behaviors. It emphasizes understanding the entire system’s behavior.

The three pillars of observability on which the foundation of observability lies are:

- Logs: These are detailed records of events within a system. It captures discrete events within the system, providing a record of all activities.
- Metrics: These are quantitative measurements of system performance. It provides data like response time or resource usage that are aggregated and analyzed over time.
- Traces: These are records of requests as they flow through distributed systems.

### How Observability Works

Observability works through a series of steps that provide deep visibility into a system's internal state by continuously collecting, correlating, and analyzing data. Let’s look at each step one by one.

Collection of High-Cardinality Data

The first step in observability is the collection of high-cardinality data, such as unique User IDs, IP addresses, or transaction IDs. This data is critical for tracking specific events within a system at a detailed level. By capturing this information, observability tools enable teams to monitor individual components and interactions, essential for identifying hidden issues. High-cardinality data provides the context needed to understand the system's state and detect anomalies.

Correlation and Analysis of Diverse Data Points

Next, observability involves correlating and analyzing diverse data points, such as logs, metrics, and traces. This step allows teams to see how different parts of the system affect each other. For example, an increase in CPU usage might correlate with a rise in error logs. By analyzing these correlations, observability tools reveal patterns and relationships that help identify the root cause of issues, offering a comprehensive view of the system's behavior.

Use of Advanced Querying and Visualization Tools

The final step involves using advanced querying and visualization tools to interpret the collected data. These tools enable teams to filter, search, and analyze information quickly, making it easier to detect and diagnose problems. Visualization tools, like dashboards and heat maps, present data in an intuitive format, allowing teams to monitor the system's health in real-time and perform root cause analysis when issues arise. This step ensures that teams can act on the data effectively to maintain system reliability.

## What is Monitoring?

Monitoring is the traditional approach to system oversight. It focuses on tracking known metrics and thresholds, alerting teams when predefined conditions are met.

Types of monitoring include:

- Infrastructure monitoring (CPU usage, memory, disk space)
- Application monitoring (response times, error rates)
- Network monitoring (bandwidth usage, latency)

Monitoring uses tools like [Signoz](https://signoz.io/) to track system performance and health. These tools collect and visualize key metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and network traffic. When these metrics exceed predefined thresholds, alerts are sent to system administrators, enabling them to address potential issues quickly. By applying tools like [Signoz](https://signoz.io/) to various system components—such as infrastructure, applications, and networks—administrators can maintain a clear, real-time view of overall system health.

Monitoring is effective for known issues but has limitations in complex, dynamic environments. It often misses issues you didn’t anticipate or set up alerts for. As a reactive approach, it can overlook emerging problems that don’t fit existing metrics, making it less adaptable to new variables. This challenge is evident in modern, distributed systems with unpredictable component interactions, underscoring the need for observability, which provides a more advanced approach.

### Challenges with Legacy Monitoring

There are many issues with legacy monitoring. Let’s look into these challenges in detail in this section.

- Scalability: As systems grow more complex, the number of metrics to monitor increases exponentially. Systems evolve to include many microservices and the complexity of monitoring increases exponentially. Traditional monitoring tools can not efficiently handle the distributed nature of microservices. The volume of data generated by each microservice coupled with the need to monitor their interactions, can overwhelm these tools.
- Alert fatigue: Too many alerts can lead to important issues being overlooked. Traditional monitoring relies on static thresholds, often generating multiple alerts. These multiple alerts may not indicate any real issues. For example, a brief increase in CPU usage will trigger an alert even if it doesn’t impact system performance. With time, these unnecessary alerts can lead to alert fatigue, and system administrators start to ignore these alerts. This increases the probability of neglect of genuinely critical alerts, leading to severe system outages or performance degradation.
- Lack of context: Isolated metrics often fail to provide the full picture of system behavior. For example, monitoring CPU usage without correlating it with application performance or user experience data can provide an incomplete picture of system health. Henceforth, the lack of context leads to difficulty in diagnosing and resolving issues effectively. This is due to the issue that administrators must manually put together information from different sources. In complex systems, this increases the time of troubleshooting and is an inefficient problem-resolution method.
- Unknown Issue Handling: Legacy monitoring is difficult in addressing unknown issues as it is highly dependent on predefined metrics and thresholds making it effective only for anticipated errors. In case of any unexpected error, legacy monitoring struggles to detect it. This can lead to ignorance of critical issues till after their escalation.

## What is Telemetry?

Telemetry involves the collection and transmission of data from remote or inaccessible sources. In IT operations, it gathers logs, metrics, traces, and events, providing insights into system performance and behavior. Logs capture specific events within a system, metrics offer quantifiable data over time, traces track requests across services, and events record state changes. This varied data is crucial in cloud-native and distributed systems, where manual monitoring is impractical.

Telemetry serves as the foundation for both observability and monitoring. Monitoring uses telemetry to track predefined metrics, while observability leverages it for deeper insights, especially in handling unexpected issues. This makes telemetry essential for real-time oversight, sophisticated analysis, and troubleshooting, ensuring reliable, high-performance IT environments.

### Types of Telemetry Data in Observability

In the context of observability, telemetry provides a wealth of data:

- Application Performance Data: This is a critical type of telemetry that provides response times, error rates, and resource usage data at the application level. This data aids teams in understanding how applications perform in real-time and can be important for identifying bottlenecks or areas of optimization.
- Infrastructure Metrics: This type of telemetry metrics focuses on CPU, memory, and disk usage across servers and containers. The various underlying hardware and cloud resources that support applications are monitored thoroughly. The effective monitoring of these metrics ensures that the infrastructure remains robots and is capable of supporting the demands placed on it by applications.
- User Behavior Analytics: This is the most recent addition in telemetry dealing with user interactions, session durations, and feature usage. It is usually employed in user-centric applications. This data tracks how users interact with a system which includes page views, clicks, session durations, and more. The understanding of user behavior aids teams in optimizing user experience and provides early indications of issues like drops in engagement or performance problems.
- Network Traffic Information: This is a vital type of telemetry that provides insight into data flow across the network and tracks various parameters like Bandwidth usage, packet loss, and latency between system components. It is important for identifying and resolving connectivity issues, ensuring data is efficiently and securely transmitted between different parts of a system, especially in distributed architectures.

This diverse data set allows observability tools to build a comprehensive picture of system behavior.
