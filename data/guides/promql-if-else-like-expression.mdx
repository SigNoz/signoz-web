Prometheus is a powerful monitoring tool, and PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) is its heart. However, one thing you may quickly realize is that PromQL doesn’t support traditional if-else statements. So, how do you implement conditional logic? In this guide, we’ll dive into the ways PromQL can simulate if-else behavior using its powerful set of operators and show you how to build dynamic queries to monitor your systems effectively.

## Understanding PromQL and Its Importance in Prometheus Monitoring

PromQL is the query language used to retrieve and manipulate time-series data stored by Prometheus. Its primary function is to extract useful insights from metric data and drive alerting and monitoring in dynamic environments.

Key features of PromQL include:

1. Time-series focus: Optimized for querying and manipulating time-stamped data.
2. Dimensional data model: Uses labels to create multi-dimensional metrics.
3. Functional approach: Treats data as vectors and applies functions to transform them.
4. Built-in aggregations: Offers various methods to combine and summarize data.

Compared to SQL or InfluxQL, PromQL shines in its ability to handle high-cardinality data and perform complex time-based calculations efficiently. This makes it ideal for monitoring microservices, containerized environments, and large-scale distributed systems.

Common use cases for PromQL include:

- Calculating error rates across services
- Monitoring resource utilization trends
- Setting up dynamic alerting thresholds
- Creating detailed performance dashboards

## The Concept of If-Else Like Expressions in PromQL

In traditional programming languages, you rely on if-else statements for decision-making. PromQL, however, doesn't have native if-else statements, which can be limiting when trying to implement conditional logic like:

- Combining multiple logical operators can result in complex and hard-to-read queries.
- Performance issues and increased error rates

However, PromQL offers operators and vector matching that help mimic if-else-like behavior. By using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `unless`, you can effectively achieve conditional querying.

Why are if-else-like expressions needed in monitoring queries? Consider these scenarios:

1. You want to alert on high CPU usage, but only during business hours.
2. You need to calculate different SLO thresholds based on the service tier.
3. You want to adjust error rate calculations based on traffic volume.

In each case, you need to apply different logic or calculations based on certain conditions — the essence of if-else logic.

## Implementing If-Else Logic Using PromQL Operators

Let's dive into the core of implementing conditional logic. We'll rely on the logical operators available in PromQL to simulate the behavior of if-else statements.

### Using the `and` Operator

The `and` operator is handy for filtering metrics based on conditions. For example, if you want to alert only when CPU usage is above 90% and the service is running, you can write:

```sql
up{job="prometheus"} == 1 and scrape_duration_seconds < 0.5
```

The query will return results only when both conditions are true (mimicking the `if` statement)

- The Prometheus service is up (`up == 1`).
- The scrape duration is less than 0.5 seconds.

### Using the `or` Operator

The `or` operator provides a fallback option. For example, if you want to monitor the number of HTTP 500 errors or the service being unavailable, you can write:

```sql
http_requests_total{status="500"} or up{job="prometheus"} == 0
```

This returns results if either of the conditions is true, like an "else if" clause. 
It checks for HTTP requests with a status of 500 (indicating server errors) or checks if the Prometheus service is down (`up == 0`).

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/promql-if-else-like-expression-image%201.webp" alt="Using the or Operator" caption="Using the or Operator" />

The query `http_requests_total{status="500"} or up == 0` checks for the total number of HTTP requests with a 500 status code, or if any targets are down (`up == 0`), returning results if either condition is true.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/promql-if-else-like-expression-image%202.webp" alt="Using the or Operator in PromQL query" caption="Using the or Operator in PromQL query" />

### Combining `and` and `or` for Complex Logic

By combining these operators, you can handle more sophisticated conditions. For example:

```sql
(up{job="python-job"} == 0 and scrape_duration_seconds{job="python-job"} < 0.5) or (up{job="prometheus"} == 0 and scrape_duration_seconds{job="prometheus"} < 0.5)
```

- The query will return true if either of the following is true:
    - The `python-job` is down and its scrape duration was fast (less than 0.5 seconds), OR
    - The `prometheus` job is down and its scrape duration was fast (less than 0.5 seconds).

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/promql-if-else-like-expression-image%203.webp" alt="Combining and and or for Complex Logic" caption="Combining and and or for Complex Logic" />

In summary, this query helps detect when either of the two jobs (`python-job` or `prometheus`) is down, while highlighting that their last scrape duration was quick, possibly indicating that the job went down right after a successful scrape.

### Example: Conditional Alerting Based on Metric Values

A common use case for if-else logic in PromQL is setting up conditional alerts. Let’s create an alert that triggers if either the Prometheus service or the Python job is down:

```sql
up{job="prometheus"} == 1 or up{job="python-job"} == 1
```

The above query returns the value 2 if both the services are operational, so you can set the threshold as a value below 2 and trigger alerts. If any one of the services is non-operational, the count will go below 2. 

Steps for setting up alerts in Grafana:

- Add Prometheus as the data source in your Grafana server.
- Go to Alerting → Alert Rules → New alert rule button.
- Provide details like:
    - Alert rule name: Any meaningful name of your choice.
    - Select the data source
    - Add in the query based on the result of which alert needs to be triggered. Set the threshold for the same.
        
        <Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/promql-if-else-like-expression-image%204.webp" alt="Setting alert rule in Grafana" caption="Setting alert rule in Grafana" />
        
    - Click on `Set as alert condition`
- Next, save the rule and exit.

Your alerts will get fired if the specified condition is met.

Handling Multiple Conditions

Multiple conditions can be handled using nested `and` and `or` operators:

```sql
(sum(prometheus_http_requests_total{job="python-job"}) > 1000 and up{job="prometheus"} == 1) or
(sum(prometheus_http_requests_total{job="python-job"}) <= 1000 and up{job="python-job"} == 1) or
(up{job="prometheus"} == 0) or
(up{job="python-job"} == 0)
```

This query evaluates multiple conditions related to the HTTP requests for the `python-job` and the status of the `prometheus` job:

1. Condition 1: `(sum(prometheus_http_requests_total{job="python-job"}) > 1000 and up{job="prometheus"} == 1)`
    - This checks if the total HTTP requests for the `python-job` exceed `1000` and the `prometheus` job is up. If both conditions are true, you may want to take action or trigger an alert.
2. Condition 2: `(sum(prometheus_http_requests_total{job="python-job"}) <= 1000 and up{job="python-job"} == 1)`
    - This checks if the total HTTP requests for the `python-job` are `1000` or fewer while ensuring that the `python-job` is operational. This may indicate that the service is underutilized.
3. Condition 3: `(up{job="prometheus"} == 0)`
    - This condition checks if the `prometheus` job is down. If true, it may trigger alerts regardless of request counts.
4. Condition 4: `(up{job="python-job"} == 0)`
    - This checks if the `python-job` is down, indicating an issue that should trigger an alert.

Dealing with Edge Cases and Potential Pitfalls

To handle edge cases, always consider:

1. What happens if a metric is missing?
2. How do you deal with label mismatches?
3. Are your time ranges consistent across conditions?

Testing conditional queries thoroughly is crucial. Use Prometheus's expression browser or tools like Grafana to visualize your query results over different time ranges and scenarios.

## Advanced Techniques for If-Else-Like Behavior in PromQL

While basic operators cover a lot, PromQL offers advanced techniques for more complex logic.

### Using the `unless` Operator

The `unless` operator is like a "negative if." It returns data only if one condition is not true:

```sql
sum(prometheus_http_requests_total) unless up{job="prometheus"} == 0
```

This query returns the total number of HTTP requests unless the Prometheus service is down.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/promql-if-else-like-expression-image%206.webp" alt="Using the unless Operator" caption="Using the unless Operator" />

### Ternary-Like Operations with Vector Matching

In a traditional ternary operator, you would write something like:

```c
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false
```

PromQL can handle ternary-like behavior using vector matching. For example, to get different results based on conditions, you can use a query like:

```sql
sum(prometheus_http_requests_total{job="prometheus"}) > 1000 or vector(0)
```

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/promql-if-else-like-expression-image%207.webp" alt="Ternary-like behavior using vector matching- Satisfying if condition" caption="Ternary-like behavior using vector matching- Satisfying if condition" />

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/10/promql-if-else-like-expression-image%208.webp" alt="Ternary-like behavior using vector matching - Satisfying else condition" caption="Ternary-like behavior using vector matching - Satisfying else condition" />

This allows you to simulate ternary logic with metrics, returning different values depending on the condition.

In this case, the expression behaves similarly:

- If `sum(prometheus_http_requests_total{job="prometheus"}) < 1000`, it evaluates to `true`, resulting in a value of `1`.
- If `sum(prometheus_http_requests_total{job="prometheus"}) >= 1000`, it evaluates to `false`, resulting in a value of `0`.

So, the PromQL expression acts like the following pseudo-ternary:

```sql
if sum(prometheus_http_requests_total{job="prometheus"}) < 1000 then 1
else 0
```

### Subqueries for Time-Based Logic

Subqueries can simulate time-dependent if-else logic. For example, if you want to check a condition over a period of time:

```
avg_over_time(metric[5m]) > 100
```

This query checks if the average value of `metric` over the last 5 minutes exceeds 100, simulating a time-based condition.

### Reusable "Functions" with Recording Rules

Recording rules allow you to precompute complex conditions and reuse them in queries, which is useful for simulating complex if-else logic across different queries.

## Real-World Scenarios: Applying If-Else Logic in Prometheus Monitoring

Let's explore some practical applications of conditional logic in PromQL:

### Holiday-Aware Alerting

In certain environments, you may want to avoid triggering alerts on specific holidays when systems are expected to operate under different conditions.

```
high_cpu_usage and on(day) (day_of_week != 6 and day_of_week != 0) 
unless on(date) holiday_calendar == 1
```

This query adjusts CPU usage alerts to account for weekends and holidays.

Explanation:

- `high_cpu_usage`: This metric represents high CPU usage.
- `and on(day)`: You are joining on the `day` label. If the `day_of_week` is labeled by `day`, you can join them accordingly.
- `(day_of_week != 6 and day_of_week != 0)`: This part filters out Saturdays (`6`) and Sundays (`0`). You should use the numeric values instead of string literals.
- `unless on(date) holiday_calendar == 1`: This excludes holidays as per the `holiday_calendar` time series, assuming that holidays are marked by `1`.

### Conditional Rate Calculations

You can perform rate calculations conditionally, depending on whether metrics cross specific thresholds. The following query calculates the request rate but only for time series where the total number of requests exceeds `1000`:

```
rate(http_requests_total[1m]) and http_requests_total > 1000
```

Explanation:

- `rate(http_requests_total[1m])`: This calculates the per-second rate of increase of `http_requests_total` over the last minute.
- `and http_requests_total > 1000`: This filters out time series where the value of `http_requests_total` is less than or equal to `1000`. The `and` operator only retains time series where both conditions are true.

### Service-Specific Monitoring

You can target specific services or instances by matching labels within your query. For example, to monitor the uptime of a particular service, you can use:

```
up{service="web",job="api"}
```

## Optimizing Performance of Conditional PromQL Queries

Complex conditional queries can impact Prometheus’ performance. Here are some optimization techniques:

1. Simplify expressions: Break down complex queries into smaller, reusable components.
2. Use pre-computed metrics: Calculate frequently used conditions in advance and store them as new metrics.
3. Optimize label matching: Use specific label matches instead of broad regex patterns.
4. Balance query frequency: Adjust scrape intervals and evaluation periods based on the metric's volatility and importance.
