Kubernetes clusters can quickly become complex, making resource monitoring a critical task for maintaining optimal performance. Enter `kubectl top` — a powerful command-line tool that provides real-time insights into your cluster's resource usage.

`Kubectl Top` command can be used to retrieve snapshots of resource utilization of pods or nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. 

In this article, we will see how to use `kubectl Top` command to get and read metrics about pods and nodes. We will also breakdown the output to understand what it means.

## Quick Guide: How to Use kubectl top Command

Before diving into the details, here's a quick reference for using `kubectl top`:

1. Monitor node resources: `kubectl top node`
2. Track pod resource usage: `kubectl top pod`
3. View specific namespace: `kubectl top pod -n <namespace>`
4. Sort by CPU usage: `kubectl top pod --sort-by=cpu`
5. Sort by memory usage: `kubectl top pod --sort-by=memory`

These commands give you a snapshot of resource utilization across your cluster. Let's explore each in more depth.

## What is kubectl?

`kubectl` is the Kubernetes command-line tool, and it allows you to run commands against your Kubernetes cluster. `kubectl` lets you interact with your Kubernetes cluster for day-to-day management. For example, `kubectl get nodes` lets you retrieve details about nodes running in your cluster or namespace.

Under the hood, `kubectl` interacts with the API server. The API server is responsible for all communication between Kubernetes components, including both the internal components of your Kubernetes cluster and external components. `kubectl` sends out `POST` commands to the API server endpoint in order to execute its commands.

## What is a pod in Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is meant to orchestrate the management of containers. Pods are the first level of abstraction that it provides over containers.

Pods are groups of one or more containers with shared resources like storage and networks. They are used as units of replication in cases where applications need to be scaled up or down.

## What is a node in Kubernetes?

Nodes are where Kubernetes pods run. Nodes can be virtual machines, bare metal servers in a data center, or instances in a private or public cloud. Kubernetes uses nodes to handle on-demand scaling of resources.

A single node can have multiple pods separated by namespaces.

## What is kubectl top and Why is it Essential?

As mentioned before, `kubectl` - pronounced (Kube: c-t-l) - is a CLI for running commands that can help you interact with a Kubernetes interface or resources in a k8 cluster. These resources include pods, deploy, replica set, etc.

It's essential for several reasons:

- **Real-time monitoring**: Get instant insights into CPU and memory usage.
- **Performance optimization**: Identify resource bottlenecks and overutilized components.
- **Capacity planning**: Make informed decisions about scaling and resource allocation.
- **Troubleshooting**: Quickly spot abnormal resource consumption patterns.

Each node in Kubernetes comes with cAdvisor, which is an open-source agent that monitors resource usage about containers. `kubectl` command gets resource utilization metrics from cAdvisor via the metrics-server.

### Understanding Kubernetes Resource Metrics

Before diving deeper into `kubectl top`, it's crucial to understand the metrics it provides:

- **CPU**: Measured in cores or millicores (1 core = 1000 millicores).
- **Memory**: Typically measured in bytes (B, KiB, MiB, GiB).

Kubernetes distinguishes between:

- **Requests**: The minimum amount of resources guaranteed to a container.
- **Limits**: The maximum amount of resources a container can use.
- **Actual usage**: The real-time consumption of resources.

`kubectl top` shows the actual usage, helping you compare it against the requests and limits to optimize your resource allocation.

To obtain these metrics, you need to run the `kubectl top` command which shows the CPU, memory, and network utilization for the containers, pods, or nodes. For the `kubectl top` command to work, you need to have metrics API installed. You can find instructions to install metrics API <a href = "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.

Now that you have a brief understanding of the concepts let’s see how the `kubectl top` command operates.

## How to Use kubectl top: A Comprehensive Guide

### Monitoring Node Resources with kubectl top node

Running the `kubectl top node` command lists metrics of the current node which would look like this:

```bash
kubectl top node

NAME                 CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
kind-control-plane   338m         4%     1662Mi          10%

```

### How to read the output from kubectl top?

The output from `kubectl top node` gives you information about CPU(cores), CPU%, memory, and memory%. Let’s see what these terms mean:

- CPU(cores)<br></br>
`338m` means 338 millicpu. `1000m` is equal to 1 CPU, hence 338m means 33.8% of 1 CPU.
- CPU%<br></br>
It is displayed only for nodes, and it stands for the total CPU usage percentage of that node.
- Memory<br></br>
Memory being used by that node
- Memory%<br></br>
It is also displayed only for nodes, and it stands for total memory usage percentage of that node.

Running the `kubectl top node <node-name>`  command lists metrics for a specific node:

```
NAME                 CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
kind-control-plane   338m         4%     1662Mi          10%

```

Running the `kubectl top node <node-name> -containers` command lists metrics for each container running on a specific node:

```
NAME                     CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
nginx-653c7b42sd-4g5ce   20m          12%    14Mi            18%
nginx-653c7b42sd-7c9ae   15m          7%     12Mi            12%

```

Running the `kubectl top node <node-name> -containers -n namespace` command lists metrics for each container running on a specific node in a specific namespace:

```
NAME                     CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
nginx-653c7b42sd-4g5ce   22m          12%    12Mi            19%
nginx-653c7b42sd-7c9ae   16m          7%     10Mi            16%
webserver-container      13m          5%     10Mi            15%

```

### Tracking Pod Resource Consumption with kubectl top pod

Running the `kubectl top pod` command displays the metrics about pods from the `default` namespace which looks like this:

```bash

NAME                     CPU(Cores)   MEMORY(Bytes)
nginx                    3m           1Mi
nginx-653c7b42sd-4g5ce   3m           1Mi
nginx-653c7b42sd-7c9ae	 3m	          1Mi

```

Here `Mi` under memory stands for mebibytes.

Running the `kubectl top pod` command with `--all-namespaces` lists down pods from all namespaces in your k8s cluster. For example, below is a snapshot from [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) k8s cluster.

```bash
kubectl top pod --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE            NAME                                                        CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)

```

You can also use the `--namespace` flag to get information about pods from a particular namespace. For example, in the below snapshot, we can see details about pods from the `platform` namespace.

```bash
kubectl top pod --namespace platform
NAME                                                        CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)

```

Running the `kubectl top pod -l <label-selector>`  command lists metrics for pods that match a specific label selector:

```
NAME                       CPU(Cores)   MEMORY(Bytes)
webserver-1                3m           1Mi
webserver-2                5m           3Mi

```

Running the `kubectl top pod <pod-name> -containers` command lists metrics for each container running in a specific pod:

```
NAME                     CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
nginx-653c7b42sd-4g5ce   20m          12%    14Mi            18%

## Use Cases of kubectl top pod/node command

Here are some use cases where `kubectl top pod` or `kubectl top node` command can be useful:

Use cases of `kubectl top node` command:

1. **Node Health Monitoring:** Monitoring the resource usage of nodes to ensure they are not overburdened, which is crucial for maintaining cluster health.
2. **Load Balancing:** Identifying under-utilized or over-utilized nodes, which can inform decisions on workload distribution and node scaling.
3. **Preventive Maintenance:** Detecting nodes with consistently high resource usage, potentially indicating the need for maintenance or upgrade.

Use cases of `kubectl top pod` command:

1. **Resource Optimization:** Identifying pods consuming excessive CPU or memory resources, enabling optimization of pod resource allocation.
2. **Troubleshooting:** Helping diagnose issues in applications by monitoring pod resource usage, especially when pods are not performing as expected.
3. **Capacity Planning:** Assisting in understanding current pod resource usage, facilitating better decisions for scaling and infrastructure planning.

## Advanced kubectl top Usage

`kubectl top` becomes even more powerful when combined with other kubectl commands and options:

1. **Use labels and selectors**: Filter pods based on labels:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl top pod -l app=nginx
    
    ```
    
2. **Monitor individual containers**: View container-level metrics within a pod:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl top pod --containers
    
    ```
    
3. **Combine with other kubectl commands**: Use `kubectl get` with `kubectl top`:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods | grep running | cut -d' ' -f1 | xargs kubectl top pod
    
    ```
    
    This command shows resource usage for all running pods.
    

Best practices for regular monitoring include:

- Set up automated checks using `kubectl top` in scripts
- Establish baseline metrics for your applications
- Regularly compare current usage against historical data

## Troubleshooting Common kubectl top Issues

When using `kubectl top`, you might encounter some common issues:

1. **"Metrics not available" error**: Ensure the Metrics Server is properly installed and running:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get deployment metrics-server -n kube-system
    
    ```
    
2. **Delayed metrics**: The Metrics Server aggregates data every 15 seconds by default. Allow some time for metrics to populate.
3. **Permission issues**: Verify your RBAC settings allow access to the Metrics API:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl auth can-i get pods.metrics.k8s.io
    
    ```
    

## Monitoring Kubernetes in Production

Resource utilization metrics are key to understanding the health of your Kubernetes cluster. From the article, you learned how to get resource utilization snapshots using the `kubectl top` command.

Though the `kubectl top` command gives you basic metrics about resource utilization, it is very convenient to inspect your nodes and pods at any time. For example, if you see that there is a sudden spike in your resource utilization, you can check which pod is consuming the most resources.

But if you're using Kubernetes in production, you can't rely on manual spot-checks to monitor your system's health and performance. **Kubernetes provides us with a smarter way to manage our resources for scaling cloud-native applications on demand**. You need to monitor your Kubernetes resources effectively.

### How can I use kubectl top to identify pods that are approaching their resource limits?

Compare the output of `kubectl top pod` with the resource limits set in your pod specifications. If usage is consistently close to the limits, consider adjusting your resource allocation.

### What is the kubectl top command used for?

The kubectl top command is used to retrieve snapshots of resource utilization metrics for pods and nodes in a Kubernetes cluster. It provides real-time insights into CPU and memory usage, helping with monitoring and performance optimization.

### How do I monitor node resources using kubectl top?

To monitor node resources, use the command `kubectl top node`. This will display CPU and memory usage for each node in your Kubernetes cluster.

### Can I view resource usage for specific pods?

Yes, you can view resource usage for specific pods using the command `kubectl top pod`. You can also use flags like `-n <namespace>` to specify a particular namespace or `-l <label-selector>` to filter pods based on labels.

### What do the CPU values mean in kubectl top output?

In kubectl top output, CPU is measured in cores or millicores. For example, "338m" means 338 millicores, which is equivalent to 33.8% of 1 CPU core.

### How can I view container-level metrics within a pod?

To view container-level metrics within a pod, use the command `kubectl top pod --containers`. This will display CPU and memory usage for each container in the pods.

### Does kubectl top show historical data or trends?

No, kubectl top only shows current usage data. For historical data and trends, you need to use a dedicated monitoring tool like SigNoz or set up your own metrics collection and storage system.

### How often should I run kubectl top for effective monitoring?

For basic monitoring, running kubectl top every 5-15 minutes can be effective. However, for more frequent checks and comprehensive monitoring, it's recommended to use a dedicated monitoring solution that continuously collects and analyzes data.

### What's required for kubectl top to work properly?

For kubectl top to work, you need to have the Metrics API installed in your Kubernetes cluster. This typically involves deploying the Metrics Server, which collects resource usage data from kubelets and makes it available through the Metrics API.
