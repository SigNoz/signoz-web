## SigNoz - Monitoring MySQL with OpenTelemetry

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is an open-source unified observability tool that can also help you monitor MySQL databases. With SigNoz, you can monitor your entire software system and track application and infrastructure metrics. Given its high-performance columnar storage for low-latency querying at scale, SigNoz is especially suited to monitoring modern cloud-native applications based on microservices and serverless architecture.

### Why Use SigNoz for MySQL Monitoring

As an open-source APM tool that monitors all your services and their multiple database instances, SigNoz can monitor the performance of database calls from every service.

<Figure src="/img/blog/2025/04/mysql-monitoring-tools-CleanShot_2025-04-21_at_13.14.002x.webp" alt="You can monitor database calls from each service of your application based on microservices architecture" caption="You can monitor database calls from each service of your application based on microservices architecture" />

SigNoz provides a metrics builder using which you can create customized dashboards to monitor your MySQL databases. You can also monitor the health and performance of the host machines where your MySQL database is hosted.

<Figure src="/img/blog/2025/04/mysql-monitoring-tools-unified-observability-infrastructure-monitoring.webp" alt="" caption="" />SigNoz also provides [distributed tracing](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-in-microservices/), which allows you to visualize how a user request performs in its entirety. You can trace calls from your front-end web application to any database interactions made during the call and pinpoint specific database queries causing performance bottlenecks.

<Figure src="/img/blog/2025/04/mysql-monitoring-tools-image.webp" alt="You can visualize user requests that resulted in MySQL queries and use the contextual information for debugging performance issues." caption="You can visualize user requests that resulted in MySQL queries and use the contextual information for debugging performance issues." />

### Pricing

- [SigNoz Cloud](https://signoz.io/pricing/) starts at $49/month.

## Prometheus

<a href="https://prometheus.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Prometheus</a> enables you to capture time-series data as metrics. You can capture metrics about MySQL query performance and stats about your MySQL deployments using Prometheus. You must install a <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MySQL exporter</a> to collect metrics from MySQL deployments and relay them to a Prometheus server.

<Figure src="/img/blog/2025/04/mysql-monitoring-tools-prometheus_mysql_dashboard.webp" alt="MySQL monitoring dashboards built using Prometheus and Grafana" caption="MySQL monitoring dashboards built using Prometheus and Grafana" />

### Why Use Prometheus for MySQL Monitoring

- Prometheus is open-source
- The exporter supports a multi-target pattern, which means you can run a single instance to connect multiple MySQL targets.

However, Prometheus comes with a very basic visualization layer. It's generally used with [Grafana](https://signoz.io/product-comparison/signoz-vs-grafana/), a visualization tool to create charts and metrics.

Besides, Prometheus does not provide distributed tracing. This means that although Prometheus can provide insights into how your MySQL instances are performing, it will not offer contextual information for your MySQL database queries.

### Pricing

- [Prometheus is free](https://signoz.io/guides/is-prometheus-free-or-paid/)
- You can get managed services or Prometheus commercial distributions from different vendors at various price points.

## Oracle Enterprise Manager

## Choosing the Right Tool to Monitor Your MySQL Databases

You can monitor MySQL servers in isolation. However, it would be much more effective if the monitoring tool helps you monitor them with contextual information like which service made the call, along with resource metrics from your infrastructure.

Having complete visibility on the entire request involving MySQL queries can help engineering teams debug performance issues faster.

For this to happen, the tool must have capabilities like distributed tracing. [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/), the open-source unified observability solution, provides distributed tracing as one of its significant features.  

Using SigNoz, you can trace your MySQL queries and see the entire request in its entirety. SigNoz uses OpenTelemetry as the agent to instrument your application and database calls. Since <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry</a> is becoming the standard way of instrumenting cloud-native applications, you can future-proof your monitoring stack with SigNoz.

SigNoz is open-source; you can check out the repo on GitHub:
