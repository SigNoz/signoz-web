The rising costs and complexities of monitoring cloud infrastructure are pushing many organizations to explore alternatives to Datadog. With monthly bills sometimes reaching thousands of dollars and feature sets that can be overwhelming, teams are looking for practical, cost-effective solutions that better fit their needs. Whether you're managing a fast-growing startup or overseeing DevOps in a large enterprise, it's crucial to understand your options to make informed decisions about your monitoring stack.

## Why Organizations Look for Datadog Alternatives

In one of the earning calls of Datadog, it was revealed that they charged a cryptocurrency company a bill of \$65 million USD. A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35837330" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Hacker News thread</b></a> discussing the report went viral, and there was an outpouring of user stories around Datadog's unpredictable billing practices.

A lot of users also pointed out how the sales team of Datadog relentlessly pursues engineers for signing up for their services, unlike some Datadog competitors.

<Figure src="/img/blog/2024/10/datadog-alternatives-CleanShot_2024-10-24_at_14.33.452x.webp" alt="" caption="" />We have come across many other horror stories around Datadog billing while interacting with our users.

Datadog's billing has two key issues:

- Very complex SKU-based pricing, which makes it impossible to predict how much it would cost.
- Custom metrics billing (\$0.05 per custom metric) - we found that custom metrics can account for [up to 52% of the total billing](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/#no-limits-on-custom-metrics-with-signoz), which just does not make sense.

## Choosing the Right Datadog Alternative

If you're looking for a Datadog alternative, you might be frustrated with its [billing practices](signoz.io/blog/datadog-pricing). So it's important to choose a tool that has transparent and predictable pricing policies. For few users, Datadog is just too complex to use with all its bells and whistles.

Monitoring and observability are critical components that you can't ignore for your applications in the production environment. As such, choosing the right tool which can empower you to take actions proactively is very important. Though DataDog is a good tool, it has its own challenges, including cost, unclear pricing policies, and complex UI.

The above DataDog alternatives can be a good option to meet your monitoring needs. If you're moving out of Datadog, a good option can be to move out of closed SaaS vendors and shift towards open source solution. Many application owners are now shifting to OpenTelemetry for their observability data. While tools like Datadog and New Relic claim that they support OpenTelemetry, [their support is not first-class](https://signoz.io/blog/is-opentelemetry-a-first-class-citizen-in-your-dashboard-a-datadog-and-newrelic-comparison/). OpenTelemetry is an open-source collection of APIs, SDKs, and tools. It can be used to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your software's performance and behavior.

Using OpenTelemetry to generate telemetry data frees you from vendor lock-in as it gives you an option to export the data to a backend of your choice. For an OpenTelemetry backend, SigNoz can be a great choice. It is built to support OpenTelemetry data natively.

## FAQs

### Who is Datadog's biggest competitor?

Datadog's biggest competitors include open-source solutions like SigNoz, New Relic, and Dynatrace. Each offers unique features and pricing models that appeal to different segments of the market.

### Is Datadog better than Splunk?

Datadog and Splunk serve different purposes with some overlap. Datadog excels in cloud infrastructure monitoring and APM, while Splunk is renowned for log management and SIEM. The choice depends on your specific needs. For a comprehensive open-source alternative, consider SigNoz, which integrates metrics, logs, and traces.

### How to replace Datadog?

To replace Datadog, you can start by identifying your monitoring and observability requirements. Then, evaluate alternatives like open Source SigNoz, New Relic, Dynatrace, or Grafana based on those requirements. Finally, migrate your monitoring setup to the chosen tool.

### What makes Datadog so good?

Datadog is popular due to its comprehensive monitoring capabilities, ease of use, and numerous integrations. Its powerful dashboards and alerting system also contribute to its appeal. However, its complex and unpredictable pricing can be a drawback. For a simpler and cost-effective solution, consider SigNoz, an open-source alternative.

### What is the weakness of Datadog?

The primary weakness of Datadog is its complex SKU-based pricing, which can lead to unpredictable and often high costs, especially for smaller organizations.

### Can Grafana replace Datadog?

Grafana can replace Datadog for many monitoring and visualization needs, especially when used with its LGTM stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, and Mimir). However, it might require more configuration and management effort compared to Datadog's all-in-one solution. For a simpler setup, consider SigNoz, which offers integrated observability with minimal hassle.

### Is Datadog SaaS only?

Yes, Datadog is a SaaS-only platform, offering its services via the cloud, which simplifies deployment and scaling for users. For those looking for an open-source alternative that can be deployed on-premise or in the cloud, consider SigNoz.

### Is Sentry better than Datadog?

Sentry and Datadog serve different purposes. Sentry focuses on error tracking and performance monitoring for applications, while Datadog offers a broader range of monitoring and observability features. The choice depends on specific needs.

### Is Datadog like Grafana?

Datadog and Grafana both provide monitoring and visualization capabilities, but Datadog is an all-in-one SaaS solution, whereas Grafana is often part of an open-source stack requiring more setup and management.

### What is the future outlook for Datadog?

The future outlook for Datadog is mixed. While its growth is driven by the increasing adoption of cloud services and the need for observability solutions, its complex pricing and feature overload can be challenging for many users. For those seeking a more streamlined and cost-effective option, SigNoz offers a compelling alternative with its open-source approach and integrated observability features.
