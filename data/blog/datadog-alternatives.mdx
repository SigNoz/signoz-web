Are you looking for a DataDog alternative? Then you have come to the right place. In this article, we will go through top 9 DataDog competitors and alternatives. One of the biggest challenge users face with DataDog is its pricing policies. Its complex SKU-based pricing policy leads to unpredictable bills.



![Cover Image](/img/blog/2024/01/datadog-alternatives-cover.webp)

DataDog is a cloud monitoring software that provides an array of tools for monitoring different aspects of your application and infrastructure. For bigger enterprises it might make sense to shell out huge monitoring bills, but it's often out of question for small and medium size enterprises.

[![Pricing concerns for DataDog](/img/blog/2021/08/datadog_alternative_reddit.webp)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/fp7xl7/warning_avoid_datadog_at_all_costs/)

In one of the earning calls of Datadog, it was revealed that they charged a cryptocurrency company a bill of \$65 million USD. A <a href = "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35837330" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" ><b>Hacker News thread</b></a> discussing the report went viral, and there was an outpour of user stories around Datadog’s unpredictable billing practices. 

A lot of users also pointed out how the sales team of Datadog relentlessly pursue engineers for signing up for their services, unlike some Datadog competitors.

We have come across many other horror stories around Datadog billing while interacting with our users.

Datadog's billing has two key issues:

- Very complex SKU-based pricing, which makes it impossible to predict how much it would cost.
- Custom metrics billing (\$0.05 per custom metric) - we found that custom metrics can account for [up to 52% of the total billing](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/#no-limits-on-custom-metrics-with-signoz), which just does not make sense.

The monitoring space is highly competitive, but there are a few products that stand out. In this article we will go through the best DatDog alternatives which you can explore while selecting your vendor for application monitoring.

List of top DataDog alternatives in 2024:

- [SigNoz (Open-Source)](#signoz-open-source)
- [New Relic](#new-relic)
- [Dynatrace](#dynatrace)
- [Prometheus](#prometheus)
- [LogicMonitor](#logicmonitor)
- [AppDynamics](#appdynamics)
- [Splunk](#splunk)
- [Sematext](#sematext)
- [Sumo Logic](#sumologic)

## SigNoz (Open-Source)

The first tool we want to discuss is, of course, SigNoz.

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is a great Datadog alternative and stands out among Datadog competitors for its open-source nature and comprehensive features. 

It is a full-stack open-source APM tool. Logs, metrics, and traces are three important signals needed to set up a robust observability stack. SigNoz provides all three signals under a [single pane of glass](https://signoz.io/blog/single-pane-of-glass-monitoring/).

One of the real challenges of using open source tools to set up an observability stack is to stitch together multiple tools like Jaeger for tracing and Prometheus for metrics. SigNoz is an open source APM that provides a SaaS-like experience. 

SigNoz is built to support OpenTelemetry natively. OpenTelemetry is quietly becoming the world standard for instrumenting cloud-native applications.

Let us see some of the features of SigNoz.

It comes with out-of-box charts for application metrics like p99 latency, error rates, request per second, and top endpoints.

## Choosing the right Datadog alternative

If you're looking for a Datadog alternative, you might be frustrated with its billing practices. So it's important to choose a tool that has transparent and predictable pricing policies. For few users, Datadog is just too complex to use with all its bells and whistles.

Monitoring and observability are critical components that you can't ignore for your applications in the production environment. As such, choosing the right tool which can empower you to take actions proactively is very important. Though DataDog is a good tool, it has its own challenges, including cost, unclear pricing policies, and complex UI.

The above DataDog alternatives can be a good option to meet your monitoring needs. If you're moving out of Datadog, a good option can be to move out of closed SaaS vendors and shift towards open source solution. Many application owners are now shifting to OpenTelemetry for their observability data. While tools like Datadog and New Relic claim that they support OpenTelemetry, [their support is not first-class](https://signoz.io/blog/is-opentelemetry-a-first-class-citizen-in-your-dashboard-a-datadog-and-newrelic-comparison/). OpenTelemetry is an open-source collection of APIs, SDKs, and tools. It can be used to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your software’s performance and behavior.

Using OpenTelemetry to generate telemetry data fress you from vendor lock-in as it gives you an option to export the data to a backend of your choice. For an OpenTelemetry backend, SigNoz can be a great choice. It is built to support OpenTelemetry data natively.
