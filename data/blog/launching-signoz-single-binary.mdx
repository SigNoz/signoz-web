At SigNoz, we are always striving to make observability simple and accessible. In response to feedback from our open-source community, we have bundled key components of SigNoz into a single binary. This means fewer moving parts, simpler maintenance, and a much smoother installation experience.

## What changed?

Till our last version, these were the components in SigNoz architecture:

- SigNoz OpenTelemetry Collector
- ClickHouse
- Query Service
- Frontend
- Alert Manager

<Figure src="/img/blog/2025/03/launching-signoz-single-binary-signoz-old-architecture.webp" alt="Previous SigNoz architecture which had multiple components like query service, alert manager and frontend." caption="Previous SigNoz architecture which had multiple components like query service, alert manager and frontend." />

We have now bundled Query Service, Frontend and Alert Manager into a single binary and have beautifully termed it as **‚ÄúSigNoz‚Äù**. üôÇ

The new architecture only has three components:

- SigNoz <br />
Single binary that packs the UI, API server, Alertmanager, Opamp, etc.
- SigNoz Otel Collector <br />
It accepts data from various sources and writes it to ClickHouse, our data storage.
- ClickHouse <br />
Our columnar data storage that is engineered specifically for analytical workloads.

Here‚Äôs what the new architecture looks like:

## Why this matters?

This architectural improvement significantly simplifies the deployment and maintenance of SigNoz, making it more accessible to a broader range of users.

Some of the key benefits include:

### Faster & Easier Installation

With fewer components to install, users can now deploy SigNoz more quickly. Instead of pulling multiple container images, you only need to install a single image, reducing setup time and complexity.

### Simplified Maintenance

Managing multiple independent services required persistent storage and individual configurations. Now, users only need to maintain a single service, reducing overhead and making troubleshooting easier.

### Reduced Infrastructure Overhead

A streamlined architecture means fewer services running in separate containers or pods, leading to reduced memory and CPU consumption. This results in improved performance and cost savings for those running SigNoz in self-hosted environments.

### Allows installation on bare metal servers

Many enterprise environments do not allow Docker or Kubernetes, requiring direct installation on Linux servers. The new SigNoz single binary allows users to install and run SigNoz seamlessly on bare-metal or virtual machines.

## Install latest Version of SigNoz

If you‚Äôre a new user, you can install the latest version of SigNoz on your preferred platform by following our [docs](https://signoz.io/docs/install/self-host/).

You can also check out our GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz).

## Instructions for existing users

Existing users will have no difficulty upgrading to the new version. The only change for existing users is that some of the commands have changed for how you interact with SigNoz.

For example, the below command which was used to exec into the query service container:

```bash
docker exec -it signoz-query-service sh
```

has now been updated to:

```bash
docker exec -it signoz-signoz sh
```

You can find the relevant commands in the Operate self-hosted SigNoz [section](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/) of our docs.

## What‚Äôs next?

We believe this change will make it much easier for users to get started with SigNoz and maintain it over time. We are committed to continuously improving the developer experience, and we welcome any feedback from our community.

If you face any issue, please create a [Github issue](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues). You can also join our [slack community](https://signoz.io/slack/), and interact with SigNoz maintainers and other community users.
