For extremely high throughput web applications, it is important to load balance the traffic across multiple servers. However, load balancing the traffic alone is not enough at times. The reverse proxy server that handles the workload needs to be performant, too. In our [previous article](https://signoz.io/blog/nginx-metrics-and-logs-monitoring-with-opentelemetry/), we discussed the NGINX reverse proxy server and understood how to monitor it. In this article, we set up monitoring for an even more performant reverse proxy server - <a href = "https://www.haproxy.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >HAProxy</a>.

## A Brief Overview of HAProxy

HAProxy proudly calls itself a reliable and highly performant load-balancer. It does just one job - and does it very well. It is an open-source server available as a load balancer for TCP and HTTP traffic. It is, in particular, used for high-traffic websites due to its performant algorithms for load-balancing requests. A single HAProxy server has been proven to serve over 2M requests per second with SSL enabled. A server this performant requires excellent monitoring, too. It does come with an inbuilt dashboard for showing its metrics, but it isn’t as intuitive as it should be. In this article, we talk about how to achieve good monitoring capabilities around HAProxy, including metrics and logs using OpenTelemetry and [Signoz](https://signoz.io).

## A Brief Overview of OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, SDKs, libraries, and integrations aiming to standardize the generation, collection, and management of telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces). It is backed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and is the leading open-source project in the observability domain.

The data you collect with OpenTelemetry is vendor-agnostic and can be exported in many formats. Telemetry data has become critical in observing the state of distributed systems. With microservices and polyglot architectures, there was a need to have a global standard. OpenTelemetry aims to fill that space and is doing a great job at it thus far.

In this tutorial, you will use OpenTelemetry Collector to collect HAProxy metrics and logs for monitoring.

### What is OpenTelemetry Collector?

OpenTelemetry Collector is a stand-alone service provided by OpenTelemetry. It can be used as a telemetry-processing system with a lot of flexible configurations to collect and manage telemetry data.

It can understand different data formats and send it to different backends, making it a versatile tool for building observability solutions.

[Read our complete guide on OpenTelemetry Collector](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-collector-complete-guide/)

## How does OpenTelemetry Collector collect data?

A receiver is how data gets into the OpenTelemetry Collector. Receivers are configured via YAML under the top-level `receivers` tag. There must be at least one enabled receiver for a configuration to be considered valid.

Here’s an example of an `otlp` receiver:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:
```

An OTLP receiver can receive data via gRPC or HTTP using the <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/docs/specification.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OTLP</a> format. There are advanced configurations that you can enable via the YAML file.

Here’s a sample configuration for an otlp receiver.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: "localhost:4318"
        cors:
          allowed_origins:
            - http://test.com
            # Origins can have wildcards with *, use * by itself to match any origin.
            - https://*.example.com
          allowed_headers:
            - Example-Header
          max_age: 7200
```

You can find more details on advanced configurations <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/otlpreceiver/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >here</a>.

After configuring a receiver, **you must enable it**. Receivers are enabled via pipelines within the service section. A pipeline consists of a set of receivers, processors, and exporters.

The following is an example pipeline configuration:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, prometheus]
      exporters: [otlp, prometheus]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp, jaeger]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp, zipkin]
```

## Pre-requisites

This tutorial assumes that you have the OpenTelemetry collector installed on the same host as your HAProxy if you plan to monitor a local HAProxy setup. In case you are looking to monitor a remote HAProxy setup, you would need to open up the network port to allow the OpenTelemetry collector to access the metrics.

Logs, however, would require an OpenTelemetry collector to run locally to access the files.

### Preparing HAProxy

HAProxy comes pre-installed for most popular Linux distributions. However, in case you do not have it installed, you can download it from <a href = "https://www.haproxy.org/#down" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >here</a> or install it by following the below instructions.

**Installing HAProxy on MacOS**

You can easily install HAProxy on MacOS using HomeBrew.

```yaml
brew update && brew install haproxy
```

**Installing HAProxy on Ubuntu**

You can install HAProxy on Ubuntu using apt

```yaml
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends software-properties-common

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:vbernat/haproxy-2.4 -y

sudo apt update && sudo apt install haproxy -y
```

**Installing HAProxy on other Linux distros using `yum`**

```yaml
yum update && yum install haproxy
```

Once installed, we can configure HAProxy to contain an endpoint showing the server statistics. In order to do so, modify `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.conf` file as shown below.

We are intentionally binding the frontend to `8000` proxy to avoid conflict with any other server running on port 80.

You would also require a backend server running behind the scenes to allow HAProxy to forward the traffic.

<Admonition>
The status URL configured is [localhost:8000/haproxy?stats](http://localhost:8000/haproxy?stats) .
</Admonition>

```yaml
global
log /dev/log  local0
---

---

---
frontend haproxy-main
bind *:8000
option forwardfor
stats uri /haproxy?stats
default_backend node_webservers
backend node_webservers
balance roundrobin
server local <your-local-webserver-url> check
```

Next, for logs, modify the file `/etc/rsyslog.d/49-haproxy.conf` (file name may differ) and add the below lines.

```yaml
$AddUnixListenSocket /var/lib/haproxy/dev/log
# Send HAProxy messages to a dedicated logfile
:programname, startswith, "haproxy" {
  /var/log/haproxy.log
  stop
}
```

Your HAProxy server is ready to serve the metrics and logs now.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will assume the following:

- HAProxy is installed on the same host when you are setting up OpenTelemetry collector
- Logs for HAProxy will be enabled and stored on the path `/var/log/haproxy.log`

Once configured, run the below commands:

```yaml
sudo service rsyslog restart
sudo service haproxy restart
```

You should start seeing stats on [http://localhost:8000/haproxy?stats](http://localhost:8000/haproxy?stats) as shown below.

    <figcaption><i>HAProxy stats on your local</i></figcaption>
</figure>


## Setting up OpenTelemetry Collector

### Step 1 - Downloading OpenTelemetry Collector

Download the appropriate binary package for your Linux or macOS distribution from the OpenTelemetry Collector <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >releases</a> page. We are using the latest version available at the time of writing this tutorial.

For MACOS (arm64):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fOL https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.90.0/otelcol-contrib_0.90.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
```

### Step 2 - Extracting the package

Create a new directory named `otelcol-contrib` and then extract the contents of the archive into this newly created directory with the following command:

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.90.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```

### Step 3 - Setting up the configuration file

In this tutorial, we would not just be monitoring the metrics of HAProxy but also visualizing its access and error logs. Let’s create a `config.yaml` in the `otelcol-contrib` folder. This will configure the collector with the HAProxy receiver for metrics and <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >File Log receiver</a> for logs.


<Admonition>
The configuration file should be created in the same directory where you unpack the `otel-collector-contrib` binary. If you have globally installed the binary, it is okay to create on any path.
</Admonition>

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: localhost:4317
      http:
        endpoint: localhost:4318
  haproxy:
    endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/haproxy?stats
    metrics:
  filelog:
    include:
      - /var/log/haproxy.log

processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 1000
    timeout: 10s
  attributes:
    actions:
      - key: app
        value: haproxy
        action: insert
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443" # replace {region} with your region
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "{your-signoz-token}" # Obtain from https://{your-signoz-url}/settings/ingestion-settings
  logging:
    verbosity: detailed
service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      address: localhost:8888
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, haproxy]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [filelog]
      processors: [attributes]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

You would need to replace `region` and `signoz-token` in the above file with the region of your choice (for Signoz Cloud) and token obtained from Signoz Cloud → Settings → Integration Settings.

    <img src="/img/blog/common/ingestion-key-details.webp" alt="You can find ingestion details in the SigNoz dashboard"/>
    <figcaption><i>You can find ingestion details in the SigNoz dashboard</i></figcaption>
</figure>


The above configuration is quite simple - We utilize the local HAProxy setup exposing statistics on `http://localhost:8000/haproxy?stats` URL. You can also monitor multiple HAproxy servers by adding multiple receivers, as shown below:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: localhost:4317
      http:
        endpoint: localhost:4318
  haproxy:
    endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/haproxy?stats
    metrics:
  haproxy/2:
    endpoint: http://<remote-url>/haproxy?stats
    metrics:
  filelog:
    include:
      - /var/log/haproxy.log

processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 1000
    timeout: 10s
  attributes:
    actions:
      - key: app
        value: haproxy
        action: insert
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443" # replace {region} with your region
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "{your-signoz-token}" # Obtain from https://{your-signoz-url}/settings/ingestion-settings
  logging:
    verbosity: detailed
service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      address: localhost:8888
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, haproxy, haproxy/2]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [filelog]
      processors: [attributes]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### Step 4 - Running the collector service

Every Collector release includes an `otelcol` executable that you can run. Since we’re done with configurations, we can run the collector service with the following command.

From the `otelcol-contrib`, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

If you want to run it in the background -

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$\!" > otel-pid
```

### Step 5 - Debugging the output

If you want to see the output of the logs, you may look it up with:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```

tail 50 will give the last 50 lines from the file `otelcol-output.log`

You can stop the collector service with the following command:

```yaml
kill "$(< otel-pid)"
```

You should start seeing the metrics on your Signoz Cloud UI in about 30 seconds.

## Monitoring with SigNoz Dashboard

You can import this dashboard <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/tree/main/haproxy" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >JSON</a> into your SigNoz environment quite easily to monitor your HAproxy instance.

Once the above setup is done, you will be able to access the metrics in the SigNoz dashboard. You can go to the Dashboards tab and try adding a new panel. You can learn how to create dashboards in SigNoz [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards-and-panels/).

    <figcaption><i>HAProxy metrics collected by OpenTelemetry collector</i></figcaption>
</figure>


You can easily create charts with [query builder](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/create-a-custom-query/#sample-examples-to-create-custom-query) in SigNoz. Here are the [steps](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-panels/#steps-to-add-a-panel-to-a-dashboard) to add a new panel to the dashboard.

    <figcaption><i>Creating a panel for Network in traffic - Bytes per second</i></figcaption>
</figure>


You can build a complete dashboard around various metrics emitted. Here’s a look at a sample dashboard we built out using the metrics collected.

    <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>


### Visualizing HAProxy logs

In order to visualize the logs sent by OpenTelemetry collector, head over to Signoz → Logs → Logs Explorer. In the logs explorer, you can filter your logs using the tag `app=haproxy`, as shown in the image below:

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2023/12/haproxy_logs.webp" alt=""/>
    <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>


You can visualize the volume of logs as well as the actual log lines easily in this UI.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you installed an OpenTelemetry Collector to collect HAProxy metrics and logs and sent the collected data to SigNoz for monitoring and alerts.

Visit our [complete guide](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-collector-complete-guide/) on OpenTelemetry Collector to learn more about it. OpenTelemetry is quietly becoming the world standard for open-source observability, and by using it, you can have advantages like a single standard for all telemetry signals, no vendor lock-in, etc.

SigNoz is an open-source [OpenTelemetry-native APM](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-apm/) that can be used as a single backend for all your observability needs.
