Welcome to the first SigNal of 2024! It is a year that we‚Äôre looking forward to accomplishing great things. We recently crossed 16,000+ GitHub stars as we continue to be amazed by the support of the developer community in our mission of open-source observability.

Let‚Äôs see what humans of SigNoz were up to in January 2024.

## What we shipped?

Latest release - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.37.2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.37.2</a>

Previous Releases - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.37.1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.37.1</a>, <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.37.0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.37.0</a>, <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.36.2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.36.2</a>


### New SigNoz Theme and Sidebar

We're excited to announce a fresh new look for SigNoz. Our latest update brings a vibrant new color scheme, fonts, and a sleek new sidebar to enhance your observability experience.

We are working towards enhancing our user experience across all features of SigNoz. Stay tuned for more exciting releases in the near future.

### Soft Min and Max Axis Limits for Charts

This was one of the popular requests from our user community. With soft `min` and `max` axis limits, the axis will not shrink down to show smaller variations in data as large mountains. So, while creating charts, you can specify a `min` and a `max` value for your axis. Actual data points will have the highest preference, so you won‚Äôt be able to set a `min` lower than an actual data point in your chart.

### Log attributes in `Raw` view of logs for better context

We provide multiple views in the logs tab, such as `Raw`, `Default`, and `Column`. The `Raw` view of logs is only used to show timestamp and body earlier. Now you can configure it to also show log attributes. This update adds richer context to the Raw view, enabling users with a more comprehensive understanding of their logs.

### Custom Date-Time value picker to support entering values

We have made it very easy to apply a time filter in our custom date-time picker. Now you can just type in values like:

- `5m` for 5 minutes
- `2h` for 2 hours, and
- `2d` for 2 days

And get your data filtered for that time range. The date-time picker is one of the most used data fields, and we plan to make it more user-friendly in future updates.

## Did OpenTelemetry deliver on its Promise in 2023?

OpenTelemetry has brought a sea change in the world of observability. The idea of the project was to standardize the instrumentation needed for generating telemetry. Teams shouldn‚Äôt need to change how they collect data if they want to try a new visualization/backend for the telemetry data. That was the vision.

Did OpenTelemetry deliver on its [promise](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-roundup-2023/) in 2023? We have shared our experience of working closely with engineering teams, big and small, who have embraced OpenTelemetry as their new standard for observability.

### Front page of HN

We were trending on the front page of Hacker News with our blog: ‚Äú[Did OpenTelemetry deliver on its promise in 2023](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-roundup-2023/)?‚Äù

It‚Äôs always amazing to see developers resonate with something we have created, and we are excited about OpenTelemetry‚Äôs promise in 2024.

### Watch out for SigNoz in 2024

SigNoz is one of the four observability tools to watch out for in 2024. We have plans to go deeper into OpenTelemetry and redefine the paradigms of open-source observability.

### Integration with ThousandEyes (A Cisco Company)

SigNoz is one of the 4 observability platforms for which ThousandEyes (a DEM platform) has default docs for sending ThousandEyes data.

It's great to see that SigNoz is one of the top few observability platforms that tools are adding to their integrations list.

### User Shoutouts ü§ó

We got a lot of user shoutouts - the best kind of motivation that keeps us going. 

We are the new hotness for all-in-one observability üôå. We are striving towards building the best developer experiences for open-source observability.

### Community Tutorials

It‚Äôs great to see community-led tutorials on SigNoz. Our mission is to create access to great open-source observability, and it‚Äôs good to see the dev community leveraging it to its full potential.

Shoutout to [Ayush](https://twitter.com/ayushpgupta) for creating a great tutorial on setting up [OpenTelemetry in a Nodejs application on Kubernetes](https://apgapg.medium.com/setup-nodejs-opentelemetry-with-signoz-on-kubernetes-68c185caffc5).

## From the Blog

OpenTelemetry can help you monitor CouchDB performance metrics with the help of OpenTelemetry Collector. CouchDB stores data in documents, which are like digital files. This makes it easy to organize and manage information. Unlike some databases that need a strict structure, CouchDB lets you change and adapt your data without any hassle. It's like having a tool that can handle different shapes and sizes of information.

In this tutorial, you will install OpenTelemetry Collector to collect CouchDB metrics and then send the collected data to SigNoz for monitoring and visualization.
