New Relic's complex pricing model and vendor lock-in concerns drive many engineering teams toward open source alternatives. If you're evaluating APM tools that offer better cost transparency, data sovereignty, and extensibility, this guide compares the leading open source options available in 2025.

## Why Teams Migrate from New Relic

### Pricing Complexity and Unexpected Costs
New Relic's hybrid pricing model combines usage-based billing with user-type tiers (Basic, Core, Full platform users). Engineering teams frequently report billing surprises when metrics volume spikes or when they need to provision additional full platform users for incident response.

### Limited Data Control
New Relic's cloud-only architecture prevents teams from:
- Keeping telemetry data within their own infrastructure for compliance
- Controlling data retention policies beyond New Relic's offerings
- Integrating with existing security and governance systems

### Vendor Dependencies
Proprietary agents and data formats create switching costs. Teams become dependent on New Relic's roadmap for critical features and bug fixes, with limited ability to extend functionality.

### Feature Complexity vs. Actual Needs
New Relic's extensive feature set often exceeds what smaller engineering teams require, making focused open source tools more practical and cost-effective.

## Key Advantages of Open Source APM Tools

**Cost Transparency**: Eliminate per-seat licensing and unpredictable usage charges. Self-hosted options provide complete control over infrastructure costs.

**Data Sovereignty**: Deploy within your own infrastructure to meet compliance requirements and maintain complete control over sensitive telemetry data.

**Extensibility**: Modify source code, build custom integrations, and contribute improvements back to the community.

**Standards Adoption**: Many open source tools embrace OpenTelemetry standards, reducing vendor lock-in and improving long-term portability.

**Community Support**: Access to active communities for troubleshooting, feature discussions, and collaborative problem-solving.
