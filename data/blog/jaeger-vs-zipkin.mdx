[Distributed tracing](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-in-microservices/) is becoming a critical component of any application's performance monitoring stack. However, setting it up in-house is an arduous task, and that's why many companies prefer outside tools. [Jaeger](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-jaeger/) and Zipkin are two popular open-source projects used for end-to-end distributed tracing. Let us explore their key differences in this article.

Both Zipkin and Jaeger are popular open-source distributed tracing tools. Zipkin was originally inspired by Google's Dapper and was developed by Twitter. Zipkin is a much older project than Jaeger and was first released as an open-source project in 2012. Jaeger was originally built by teams at Uber and then open-sourced in 2015. It got accepted as a Cloud Native incubation project in 2017 and graduated in 2019.

## What is distributed tracing?

In the world of microservices, a user request travels through hundreds of services before serving a user what they need. To make a business scalable, engineering teams are responsible for particular services with no insight into how the system performs as a whole. And that's where distributed tracing comes into the picture.

Distributed tracing gives you insight into how a particular service is performing as part of the whole in a distributed software system. There are two important concepts involved in distributed tracing: [**Spans**](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-span/) and [**trace context**](https://signoz.io/blog/context-propagation-in-distributed-tracing/).

## What are Distributed Tracing Tools?

Distributed tracing tools provide visibility into the flow of requests as they traverse through various services in a distributed system. These tools help developers and operators understand the performance characteristics and behavior of their applications at a granular level.

Key components of distributed tracing include:

- **Spans**: Represent a unit of work or operation within a trace.
- **Traces**: A collection of spans that form a tree-like structure, showing the path of a request.
- **Context Propagation**: The mechanism for passing trace information between services.

Benefits of using distributed tracing tools:

1. **End-to-end visibility**: Trace requests across multiple services and databases.
2. **Performance optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and latency issues in your system.
3. **Root cause analysis**: Quickly pinpoint the source of errors or slow performance.
4. **Service dependency mapping**: Understand how different components of your system interact.

OpenTelemetry, an open-source observability framework, has emerged as a standard for instrumenting, generating, and collecting telemetry data. It provides a unified way to instrument applications for various tracing tools, including Jaeger and Zipkin.

### Instrumentation Libraries

Instrumentation is the process of generating telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces) from an application code. Both Jaeger and Zipkin provide language-specific instrumentation libraries. Instrumentation enables a service to create spans on incoming requests and to attach context information on outgoing requests.

Key points to note about instrumentation libraries of Jaeger and Zipkin:

- Jaeger recommends using OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs for generating traces. Using OpenTelemetry users have the advantage of using a single open source standard for all types of telemetry signals as OpenTelemetry aslo supports logs and metrics.
- Zipkin provides client libraries in popular languages like C#, Go, Java, Javascript, Ruby, Scala, PHP, etc. There are also a lot of community supported libraries that you can use for instrumenting specific frameworks.

{/* <!-- - Jaeger's instrumentation libraries are based on <a href="https://opentracing.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>OpenTracing APIs</b></a>. OpenTracing was also started at Uber with an aim to create vendor-neutral instrumentation APIs for distributed tracing. Zipkin has its own instrumentation libraries.

- Jaeger has <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.26/client-libraries/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>official client libraries</b></a> in Go, Java, Node.js, Python, C++, C#. Zipkin team maintains <a href="https://zipkin.io/pages/tracers_instrumentation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>instrumentation libraries</b></a> for frameworks in C#, Go, Java, Javascript, Ruby, Scala, and PHP. --> */}
- Both Jaeger and Zipkin support out-of-box instrumentation for a lot of popular frameworks. Jaeger is also compatible with Zipkin's API. That means you can use instrumentation libraries of Zipkin with Jaeger.

### Collectors

Telemetry data collected by the instrumentation libraries are sent to a collector in both Jaeger and Zipkin. Jaeger's collectors validate traces, index them, perform any transformations, and finally stores them. Zipkin collector too validates and indexes the collected trace data for lookups.

### Query Service and Web UI

Zipkin provides a JSON API for finding and retrieving traces. Jaeger provides stateless service API endpoints which are typically run behind a load balancer, such as NGINX.

The consumer of the query service is a Web UI in both Jaeger and Zipkin, which is used to visualize trace data by a user.
