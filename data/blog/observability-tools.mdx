In microservices architecture, observability tools enable you to create central dashboards to gauge the health of your distributed systems. New age observability tools have shifted to providing quick workflows to debug application issues. In this post we will explore top 11 observability tools that you can consider to use for your software systems.



![Cover Image](/img/blog/2024/01/observability-tools-cover.webp)

In today's digital economy, distributed architectures have become the norm. Organizations are also opting for polyglot microservices to boost developer productivity. But how do you manage the operational challenges of such systems?

Customer experience is the key to the success of tech companies of any size, be it startups, mid or large-level enterprises. You need to proactively solve for things like availability and performance of your applications in production.
And that's where observability comes into the picture. A robust observability framework is now critical for maintaining your systems in fine health. Observability is powered by telemetry data - a combination of logs, metrics, and traces.

## What is an Observability Tool?

The aim of observability is to solve customer issues quickly. Creating monitoring dashboards is useless if it can’t help engineering teams quickly identify the root causes of performance issues.

A modern distributed software system has a lot of moving components. So while setting up monitoring, you might not know what answers you would need to solve an issue. And that’s where observability comes into the picture.

An observability tool enables application owners to get answers to any question that might arise while debugging application issues. Usually, an observability tool helps you to monitor three signals - metrics, traces, and logs.


{/* <!-- A good observability tool has many components:

1. It should enable you to generate, sample, process, and emit telemetry data.

2. It should have a good storage system for fast retrieval and long-term retention.

3. It should have a good visualization layer for your teams to consume and take action.

In this article, let's explore the top 9 observability tools in 2023 which can be perfect for your microservice application. --> */}

## How to choose the right observability tool?

For applications with microservices architecture, observability tools have become critical to meet operational challenges at scale. Without observability, it is almost impossible for your engineering teams to troubleshoot bugs and assess the performance of your applications. Hence choosing the right observability tool for your application is important. A few questions to ask yourself before selecting an observability tool are as follows:

- Are there any privacy laws that you need to take care of while sharing user's data with a third-party tool?
- Does the pricing suit your budget?
- How easy is it to get started with things like instrumentation?
- How much data do you want to retain?
- Does the tool provide seamless integration between metrics, logs, and traces?

An open-source tool like [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/), can be your best option in today's privacy-driven digital economy. Moreover, SigNoz uses open-source standards for instrumentation, and its code can be assessed for quality from its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz). Finally, as the tool is open-sourced, you get the support of the community while having access to out-of-box features like a SaaS vendor.

## Best Practices for Maximizing the Value of Observability Tools

To get the most out of your observability implementation:

1. **Set clear goals**: Define specific objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs) for your observability efforts.
2. **Instrument thoroughly**: Ensure comprehensive coverage across your entire technology stack.
3. **Foster a culture of observability**: Encourage all team members to use and contribute to observability practices.
4. **Continuously improve**: Regularly review and refine your observability strategy based on insights gained and evolving needs.

## FAQs

### What's the difference between monitoring and observability?

Monitoring focuses on tracking predefined sets of metrics and known issues, while observability provides a more comprehensive view of system behavior, allowing you to explore and diagnose unforeseen problems.

### How do observability tools impact application performance?

Observability tools can have a minimal impact on performance when properly implemented. Most modern tools are designed to be lightweight and efficient. However, it's important to monitor the overhead of your observability solution and adjust as needed.

### Can observability tools help with compliance and security?

Yes, many observability tools offer features that support compliance and security efforts. They can help track access patterns, detect anomalies, and provide audit trails — all crucial for maintaining a secure and compliant environment.
