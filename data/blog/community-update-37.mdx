### Unlimited dashboards and alerts in the community version

We have enabled unlimited dashboards and alerts in the community version of SigNoz to make it more accessible to engineering teams. We want to provide a great user experience to our open-source users, and unlimited dashboards and alerts will help them set up and monitor their applications effectively.

### Create new sections with collapsable rows for dashboards

We have improved the user experience of dashboards by enabling new sections in dashboards. Now, you can create multiple sections in your dashboard and collapse them for a better browsing experience.

### Sorted tags and events in Trace Detail Page

The tags and events in the Trace detail page are now sorted alphabetically. Tags and events help you get more context on operations in your application.

### Show milliseconds in timestamp in logs view

We have added milliseconds in the timestamp for the logs view for those who want higher accuracy in understanding when their logs were emitted.

## Scaling OpenTelemetry Collectors using Kafka

You can introduce Kafka as a buffering layer between your OTel collectors and the backend to handle data spikes and ensure reliable data transmission. The setup involves configuring a fleet of horizontally scalable OTel collectors, known as Gateway OTel collectors, to receive telemetry data from various sources. 

These collectors then use a Kafka exporter to send the data to a Kafka cluster. Kafka acts as a queuing system, providing a buffer that can absorb sudden spikes in data, thus preventing data loss and allowing the system to handle increased load without overloading the OTel collectors. Additionally, Kafka enables advanced processing capabilities like tail-based sampling, making it easier to manage and process large volumes of telemetry data efficiently.

Learn more about scaling OpenTelemetry collectors with Kafka from the video below.

## From the Blog

Spans are fundamental building blocks of distributed tracing. A single trace in distributed tracing consists of a series of tagged time intervals known as spans. Spans represent a logical unit of work in completing a user request or transaction.

Hereâ€™s an article explaining what spans are in the context of distributed tracing.
