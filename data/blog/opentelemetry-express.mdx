You can monitor your express application using OpenTelemetry and a tracing backend of your choice. OpenTelemetry is the leading open-source standard under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation that aims to standardize the process of instrumentation across multiple languages.

In this article, we will be usingÂ [**SigNoz**](https://signoz.io/)Â to store and visualize the telemetry data collected by OpenTelemetry from a sample Express.js application.

Steps to get started with OpenTelemetry for an Express.js application:

- Creating a SigNoz cloud account
- Creating a sample express application
- Setting up OpenTelemetry and sending data to SigNoz
- Monitoring your Application in SigNoz

## Creating a SigNoz cloud account

SigNoz cloud is the easiest way to run SigNoz. You can sign upÂ [**here**](https://signoz.io/teams/)Â for a free account and get 30 days of unlimited access to all features.

After you sign up and verify your email, you will be provided with details of your SigNoz cloud instance. Once you set up your password and log in, you will be greeted with the following onboarding screen.

## Creating a Sample Express Application

This section guides you through setting up a basic Express.js application, instrumenting it with OpenTelemetry, and sending telemetry data to SigNoz.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 12 or newer. Download the latest version of Node.jsÂ [**here**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Quick Start

To avoid manual setup, clone the [sample Express.js app repository](https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-nodejs-app), which is pre-configured with OpenTelemetry instrumentation. However, to fully understand the process, you are recommended to follow the steps below.

### Steps to Build the Application

For the sample application, let's create a basic 'hello world' express.js application.

1. **Verify Node installation**
    
    Check if Node.js is installed:
    
    ```jsx
    node - v
    ```
    
2. **Make a directory and install Express**
    
    Make a directory for your sample app on your machine. Then open up the terminal, navigate to the directory path and install Express with the following command:
    
    ```jsx
    npm i express
    ```
    
3. **Create index.js**
    
    Create a file calledÂ **`index.js`**Â in your directory, and with any text editor, setup your 'Hello World' file with the code below:
    
    ```jsx
    const express = require("express");
    const cors = require("cors");
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || "5555";
    const app = express();
    
    app.use(cors());
    app.use(express.json());
    
    app.all("/", (req, res) => {
      res.json({ method: req.method, message: "Hello World", ...req.body });
    });
    
    app.get("/404", (req, res) => {
      res.sendStatus(404);
    });
    
    app.listen(parseInt(PORT, 10), () => {
      console.log(`Listening for requests on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
    });
    ```
    
4. **Check if your application is working**
    
    Run your application using the command below on your terminal.
    
    ```jsx
    node index.js
    ```
    
    You can check if your app is working by visitingÂ [**http://localhost:5555/**](http://localhost:5555/)

    <figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2024/12/node-app-running.webp" alt="Express App started successfully"/>
    <figcaption><i>Express application running</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    Once you are finished checking, exit the application by usingÂ **`Ctrl + C`**Â on your terminal.
    

## Setting up OpenTelemetry and sending data to SigNoz

SigNoz offers various [instrumentation methods](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-javascript/#send-traces-to-signoz-cloud) to help you send telemetry data from your application to SigNoz Cloud for comprehensive monitoring and analysis. In this tutorial, we will utilize the [No Code Automatic Instrumentation](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-javascript/#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud---no-code-automatic-instrumentation-recommended) method, which simplifies the process by collecting telemetry data without requiring code changes.

1. **Install OpenTelemetry Packages**
    
    To enable telemetry data collection for your application, you need to install the necessary OpenTelemetry packages. Use the following commands:
    
    ```jsx
    npm install --save @opentelemetry/api
    npm install --save @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
    ```
    
    These libraries enable automatic instrumentation and interaction with the OpenTelemetry API:
    
    - **`@opentelemetry/sdk-node`**Â - This package provides the full OpenTelemetry SDK for Node.js including tracing and metrics.
    - **`@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node`**Â - This module provides a simple way to initialize multiple Node instrumentations.
    - **`@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http`**Â - This module provides the exporter to be used with OTLP (**`http/json`**) compatible receivers.
    
    ðŸ’¡ **Note**: If you run into any error, you might want to use these pinned versions of OpenTelemetry libraries used in [this](https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-nodejs-app/blob/master/package.json).
    
2. **Configure Environment Variables**
    
    To configure OpenTelemetry for your application, export the necessary environment variables. These variables define the data export settings and identify your application in SigNoz.
    
    Run the below in your terminal:
    
    ```jsx
    export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER="otlp"
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT="<SIGNOZ_ENDPOINT>"
    export OTEL_NODE_RESOURCE_DETECTORS="env,host,os"
    export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="<APP_NAME>"
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
    export NODE_OPTIONS="--require @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node/register"
    ```
    
    Here is a breakdown of the environment variables used:
    
    | **Variable** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | **`OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER`** | Specifies the traces exporter. Set to `"otlp"` to use the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting trace data. |
    | **`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`** | The SigNoz ingestion URL. You should have received this URL via email after registering with SigNoz Cloud. |
    | **`OTEL_NODE_RESOURCE_DETECTORS`** | Identifies additional resource metadata such as environment, host, and OS for better trace context. |
    | **`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`** | The name of your application. This will appear in SigNoz as the service being monitored. |
    | **`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`** | Contains authentication headers, including your SigNoz ingestion key. |
    | **`NODE_OPTIONS`** | Configures the Node.js runtime to preload OpenTelemetry's auto-instrumentation library. |
    
    Be sure to replace `<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>` with your actual SigNoz ingestion key. If you haven't created one yet, you can follow [this guide](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/) to generate your ingestion key.

    <figcaption><i>Variable config</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    
3. **Start the Application**
    
    After setting the environment variables, start your application by running:
    
    ```jsx
    node index.js
    ```
    
    You can check your application running atÂ [**http://localhost:5555/**](http://localhost:5555/). 
    
    You need to generate some load in order to see data reported on SigNoz dashboard. Refresh the endpoint for 10-20 times, and wait for 2-3 mins.
