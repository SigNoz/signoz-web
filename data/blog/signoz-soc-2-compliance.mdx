## What is SOC 2?

SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2) is a set of standards developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) for managing customer data based on five "trust service principles": security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. These standards are specifically designed for service providers storing customer data in the cloud, ensuring they have the necessary controls in place to protect this data. SOC 2 reports are unique to each organization, reflecting its specific controls and practices regarding data security and operational effectiveness.

A SOC 2 audit assesses the extent to which an organization complies with these trust principles, providing a detailed report on its internal controls and processes. This audit can result in a SOC 2 Type I report, which describes the organization's systems and whether they are suitably designed to meet the relevant trust principles at a specific point in time, or a SOC 2 Type II report, which details the operational effectiveness of these systems over a period of time. Obtaining SOC 2 certification demonstrates an organization’s commitment to data security and privacy, building trust with clients and stakeholders.
