OpenTelemetry and OpenTracing are open-source projects used to [instrument application](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/) code for generating telemetry data. While OpenTelemetry can help you generate logs, metrics, and traces, OpenTracing focuses on generating traces for distributed applications.

Before we see the differences between OpenTelemetry and OpenTracing, let’s have a brief overview of what each technology is.

## What is OpenTelemetry?

<a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry</a> is an open-source project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation(<a href = "https://www.cncf.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CNCF</a>) that aims to standardize the generation and collection of telemetry data. Telemetry data includes logs, metrics, and traces.

It was formed after the merger of OpenTracing and OpenCensus, two projects with similar goals but different approaches.

**OpenTelemetry is a collection of APIs, SDKs, and client libraries used to generate telemetry data from your application code.** 

The data you collect with OpenTelemetry is vendor-agnostic and can be exported in many formats.

The biggest advantage of using OpenTelemetry is that you have the freedom to choose a backend of your choice. You don’t get locked into a vendor, and engineering teams can get ramped up on a single technology to generate telemetry data.

You can try SigNoz, a full stack open-source APM built natively on OpenTelemetry.
> 

To integrate OpenTelemetry with your application code, you can use the OpenTelemetry client libraries of the required programming language. OpenTelemetry also provides a collector known as OTel(OpenTelemetry) collector that can be used to process and export telemetry data in multiple formats.

<figcaption><i>Architecture - How OpenTelemetry fits in an application architecture. OTel collector refers to OpenTelemetry Collector</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Key components of OpenTelemetry include:

1. **APIs**: Define how to generate and manage telemetry data.
2. **SDKs**: Implement the APIs for various programming languages.
3. **Collector**: Receives, processes, and exports telemetry data.

OpenTelemetry supports three main types of telemetry data:

- **Traces**: Track the flow of requests through distributed systems.
- **Metrics**: Measure the performance and behavior of applications.
- **Logs**: Capture detailed information about events and errors.

## What is OpenTracing?

<a href = "https://opentracing.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTracing</a> is a vendor-neutral API standard for distributed tracing. It focuses on providing a consistent way to instrument applications for tracing across different languages and platforms.

It is difficult for engineering teams to see how requests are performing across services. And that’s where distributed tracing comes into the picture.

But the problem for large organizations in adopting distributed tracing was the lack of reusable instrumentation for a vast number of open-source frameworks and libraries.

OpenTracing APIs were meant to solve this by developing a common instrumentation API.

The core concepts of OpenTracing include:

- **Spans**: Represent a unit of work or operation.
- **Traces**: A collection of spans that form a complete request path.
- **Context propagation**: Passing trace information across service boundaries.

While OpenTracing excelled at standardizing distributed tracing, it had limitations when addressing broader observability needs. This shortcoming eventually led to its evolution into OpenTelemetry.

## OpenTelemetry vs OpenTracing

OpenTelemetry was formed after the merger of OpenTracing and OpenCensus and is currently being actively developed as the single standard for application instrumentation under CNCF. OpenTelemetry combines the functionalities of OpenTracing and OpenCensus and also extends them.

While OpenTelemetry can be your single source for all kinds of telemetry data like logs, metrics, and trace

s, OpenTracing was focused only on distributed tracing. For users who are using OpenTracing APIs, they can migrate to OpenTelemetry.

**For organizations and developers currently on the fence, the choice is clear: OpenTelemetry. Not only does it encompass the functionalities of OpenTracing, but it also offers extended capabilities.** 

With OpenTracing being deprecated, migrating to OpenTelemetry is the logical step forward. The transition is made easier by OpenTelemetry's active efforts to ensure backward compatibility and its comprehensive approach to telemetry data.

### OpenTelemetry vs OpenTracing: Feature Comparison

To understand why OpenTelemetry has become the preferred choice, let's compare its features with OpenTracing:

1. **Scope of telemetry data:**
    - OpenTelemetry: Covers traces, metrics, and logs.
    - OpenTracing: Focuses solely on distributed tracing.
2. **Language and framework support:**
    - OpenTelemetry: Offers extensive support for multiple languages and frameworks.
    - OpenTracing: Provides support for several languages but with less active development.
3. **Vendor neutrality and ecosystem compatibility:**
    - OpenTelemetry: Designed for seamless integration with various backends and tools.
    - OpenTracing: Offers vendor neutrality but with a smaller ecosystem.
4. **Performance and overhead:**
    - OpenTelemetry: Optimized for minimal performance impact.
    - OpenTracing: Generally lightweight but may vary depending on implementation.

### Data Model and Instrumentation

The data model and instrumentation approaches differ significantly between OpenTelemetry and OpenTracing:

1. OpenTelemetry's unified data model:
    - Provides a consistent structure for traces, metrics, and logs.
    - Enables correlation between different types of telemetry data.
2. OpenTracing's tracing-specific model:
    - Focuses on span and trace concepts.
    - Lacks native support for metrics and logs.
3. Instrumentation approaches:
    - OpenTelemetry: Offers auto-instrumentation libraries and manual instrumentation APIs.
    - OpenTracing: Requires manual instrumentation in most cases.
4. Backward compatibility:
    - OpenTelemetry: Includes a compatibility layer for OpenTracing, easing migration.
    - OpenTracing: No direct compatibility with OpenTelemetry.

## Why Choose OpenTelemetry over OpenTracing?

Several factors make OpenTelemetry a more attractive choice for modern observability needs:

1. **Comprehensive observability:** OpenTelemetry's support for traces, metrics, and logs provides a complete picture of your system's health and performance.
2. **Future-proofing:** As the successor to OpenTracing, OpenTelemetry benefits from ongoing development and community support.
3. **Broader ecosystem**: OpenTelemetry's wide adoption means better integration with cloud-native tools and services.
4. **Simplified instrumentation**: Auto-instrumentation capabilities reduce the effort required to implement observability in your applications.

## Migrating from OpenTracing to OpenTelemetry

If you're currently using OpenTracing, here's a step-by-step guide to migrate to OpenTelemetry:

1. Assess your current OpenTracing implementation:
    - Identify all instrumented components.
    - Document custom instrumentation and integrations.
