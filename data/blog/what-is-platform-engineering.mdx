In the world of DevOps and cloud engineering, a new buzzword has emerged: Platform Engineering. This concept has sparked discussions across the industry, with professionals debating whether it replaces traditional DevOps or adds value to it. In reality, Platform engineering transforms how software teams work. It builds on DevOps principles to create self-service tools that boost developer productivity. This approach streamlines workflows, enhances security, and cuts operational costs. As organizations seek to scale their software delivery, platform engineering emerges as a critical discipline. Let's explore what platform engineering is and how it empowers developers.

## What is Platform Engineering?

Before discussing the definition of platform engineering, lets discuss why we really need this?

Think of a situation when many developers work on different parts of a project, they often need the same tools and services, like databases, servers, or testing environments. Setting up and managing these tools individually for each developer can be time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent. The solution is to build a platform where all the tools, services and databases are integrated in one environment which also doesn’t hinder the collaboration between developers and operations. 

Platform engineering is a field in software development focused on creating and managing a shared set of tools, services, and environments that developers use to build, test, and deploy their applications. It evolved from DevOps principles, focusing on self-service capabilities for software teams.Think of it as building a "digital workbench" that developers can use to do their jobs more easily and efficiently.

### Core Principles of Platform Engineering

 The core of platform engineering includes:

- Toolchains: These are integrated sets of development tools that include everything from code editors and version control systems to testing frameworks and deployment automation. Platform engineers ensure these tools work seamlessly together, providing a smooth development experience.
- Workflows: These are standardized processes for developing, testing, and delivering software. Platform engineers design workflows that streamline tasks like code integration, testing, and deployment, making them consistent and repeatable across different projects.
- Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs): These are self-service interfaces that allow developers to access the tools and environments they need without having to understand or manage the underlying infrastructure. IDPs are like a "one-stop shop" where developers can easily set up environments, deploy code, and monitor their applications.

### How is Platform Engineering different from DevOps

Generally, platform engineering often get confuse with DevOps. There are some difference between them:

1. Platform engineering focuses on building and maintaining a shared platform for developers, while DevOps focus on  the collaboration and automation of the entire software delivery process.
2. Platform engineers create and manage the tools and environments developers use, whereas DevOps engineers streamline and automate the integration, testing, and deployment of software.
3. Outcome: Platform engineering aims to provide a consistent and scalable environment, making development easier, while DevOps seeks to improve the speed and reliability of software delivery by integrating development and operations efforts.
4. Usage: Platform engineering provides developers with self-service tools and environments, whereas DevOps involves practices and tools that facilitate continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

Overall, Platform engineering aims to remove obstacles in the software development lifecycle. It provides developers with the necessary tools and infrastructure — without requiring them to be infrastructure experts.

This diagram shows a platform, or Internal Developer Platform (IDP), that centralizes various tools and services for different developer teams (like Web, Mobile, and Data Science teams) in an organization. The platform integrates tools such as Jenkins for continuous integration, container platforms for managing applications, infrastructure provisioning tools, and monitoring systems. This setup facilitates collaboration between the platform team and developer teams, allowing developers to focus on building applications while the platform handles the underlying infrastructure and tooling.

### Key Principles of Platform Engineering

Platform engineering follows several key principles:

- Automation and standardization: Repetitive tasks are automated, and processes are standardized across the organization.
- Self-service capabilities: Developers can access resources and tools without relying on other teams.
- Golden paths: Predefined, optimized workflows that guide developers through common tasks.
- Continuous improvement: Feedback loops ensure the platform evolves with the needs of its users.

## Why Platform Engineering Matters

Imagine a software organization with multiple DevOps teams, each specializing in different aspects of product development. Each team has chosen open-source tools that are well-regarded in the community but come without commercial backing or enterprise version.

<Figure src="/img/blog/2024/08/what-is-platform-engineering-Screenshot_2024-08-06_at_11.27.13_AM.webp" alt="Platform Engineering Tools" caption="Platform Engineering Tools" />

- Workflow Automation: Leverages workflow management tools like Apache Airflow to automate and manage complex processes, enabling more focus on core tasks rather than process orchestration.
- Proactive Monitoring and Logging: Implements monitoring tools such as Prometheus to provide real-time insights into application and infrastructure performance, facilitating proactive issue resolution and system optimization.

## IDP and its Components

A key component of platform engineering is the Internal Developer Platform (IDP). This platform acts as an abstraction layer over the complexity of infrastructure and operations. It provides a user-friendly interface—like a UI or API—through which developers can access, configure, and deploy the resources they need without direct involvement from the platform team. This setup ensures that while standardization is maintained, flexibility and autonomy are not compromised.

Components of IDP:

1. CI/CD Platforms: It automates the software release process, enhancing delivery speed and reliability. Examples: Jenkins, Argo CD etc.

2. Container Orchestration Platforms: It manages and automates container deployment, scaling, and operations. Examples: Kubernetes, Nomad, Docker Swarm etc.

3. Security Management Tools:  It secures access control, manages secrets, and provides comprehensive identity management. Examples: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Keyvault etc.

4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tools: It manages and provision infrastructure using code for better consistency and scalability. Examples: Terraform, Ansible, Chef,  ARM templates, Bicep files  and AWS CloudFormation

5. Observability Stack: It monitors and visualizes applications and infrastructure to ensure optimal performance and health. Examples: [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/docs/introduction/), [Azure app insights](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-azure-monitor-metrics/)

These components collectively empower organizations to automate their infrastructure and development workflows, enhancing both efficiency and security.

## The Role of Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)

Key features of effective IDPs include:

- Infrastructure abstraction: Developers interact with high-level concepts rather than raw infrastructure.
- Environment management: Easy creation and management of development, staging, and production environments.
- Service catalog: A curated list of approved services and tools for developers to use.
- Automated compliance: Built-in checks ensure all deployments meet security and compliance standards.

Using these IDPs, Developers can choose the right level of abstraction to run their applications. Let’s say, you want to build something around Helm charts, Kubernetes, and deploying using GKE. Now, you have the flexibility to just self-serve an environment that comes fully provisioned with everything they need to deploy and test their code, without worrying about where it runs!
