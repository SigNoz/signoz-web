Welcome to the 31st edition of our monthly product newsletter - SigNal 31! We shipped a lot of improvements in our dashboard user experience and crossed 7 million Docker downloads.

Let‚Äôs see what the humans of SigNoz did in the month of November 2023.

## What we shipped?

Latest release - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.34.3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.34.3</a>

Previous Releases - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.34.2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.34.2</a>, <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.34.1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.34.1</a>, <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.34.0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.34.0</a>

### Moved to uPlot as our charting library

We have moved to <a href = "https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >uPLot</a> as our charting library. Our users build a lot of customized dashboards with multiple charts and panels. uPlot will help improve the overall performance of the dashboards along with the initial render time and zoom and cursor performance.

### Add thresholds in Time-Series, Table, And Value View

You can set thresholds in different types of views in SigNoz. While creating any view in Dashboards, we have added an option to set thresholds. You can also customize things like color, text, or background.

Thresholds help you understand if a time series or value has crossed a limit and help you identify it just by visual inspection so that you can focus on what‚Äôs really important.

### Improvements in Dashboard

We made a lot of improvements in the SigNoz Dashboards tab. The Dashboard tab is used to create customized dashboards to monitor specific components of your tech stack. For example, you can build a dashboard with charts and panels for your MongoDB database.

We made the following improvements:

**Full Screen View**

We have added `Full Screen View` for dashboards to make it easier to view all charts and panels. It‚Äôs useful when your team is monitoring specific dashboards by projecting them on a monitor or large screen. You can focus better on the charts without any distractions.

    <figcaption><i>You can now view your Dashboards in ‚ÄúFull Screen View‚Äù</i></figcaption>
</figure>


**Alerts in Dashboard**

You can directly create alerts for any charts or panels by clicking on the dropdown and then clicking on Create Alerts. It saves the effort of writing the query again in Alerts builder.

    <figcaption><i>Create Alerts directly from Dashboards Tab</i></figcaption>
</figure>


### Fill Span Gaps Option for Charts

`Fill Span Gaps` option helps control how the chart handles missing or undefined data points (gaps) in a series. When `Fill Span Gaps` is set to disabled , it instructs the chart to draw a continuous line even when there are gaps in the data (i.e., some data points are missing).

If a data series has gaps and `Fill Span Gaps` is enabled, the line would typically be dropped to 0 at the position of the missing data points.

## Observability: Insurance vs Growth Driver

When you think about observability, do you think of it as an insurance or a growth driver? Folks who see observability as an insurance driver tend to use it to do things like finding the root cause of something when it goes wrong.

However, users who see observability as a growth driver try to solve a business issue that improves usage and monetization. Read on to find out how we think you can utilize observability to justify the cost of using a tool.

## SigNoz Webinars

**OpenTelemetry Webinars: The Open Agent Management Protocol**

Open Agent Management Protocol (OpAMP) is the emerging open standard for managing a fleet of telemetry agents at scale. In this webinar, Nica and Srikanth talk about OpAMP in detail, discussing what it is, what it means for an end-user, and how to use it. Check out the entire webinar here üëá

**OpenTelemetry Webinars: The Trace API**

In this webinar, Nica and Srikanth discuss the Trace API in detail. They talk about adding spans, events, attributes, and other extra info, whether it's really possible to replace logs with traces, and more. Check out the entire webinar hereüëá

## From the blog

PostgreSQL metrics monitoring is important to ensure that PostgreSQL is performing as expected and to identify and resolve problems quickly. OpenTelemetry Collector can collect metrics from your PostgreSQL instances and send them to a backend of your choice for monitoring and visualization.

In this tutorial, learn how to configure the PostgreSQL receiver in OpenTelemetry Collector to collect important metrics about PostgreSQL performance.
