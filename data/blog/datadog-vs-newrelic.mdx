**For a deeper dive into the specific features and performance of New Relic vs DataDog, let's explore the detailed comparison in the sections below.**

## APM: Datadog for More Control, New Relic for Simplicity

I instrumented a sample Java application and sent data to both DataDog and New Relic for APM. The steps are almost the same in both DataDog and New Relic, with New Relic having a few extra steps. Both New Relic and DataDog require you to install their agent as well as a programming language-specific agent, which, in my case, was a Java agent.

### DataDog APM

In DataDog, I had a hard time figuring out whether my setup was complete or not, and I found the onboarding flow of New Relic much better.

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
  <img
    className="box-shadowed-image"
    src="/img/blog/2024/02/datadog-onboarding-tabs.webp"
    alt="Datadog's onboarding tab"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <i>DataDog's onboarding flow is a bit overwhelming, with too many horizontal tabs.</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The good thing about DataDog is it gives you a lot of control. You can set up things like collecting custom metrics (which might be [expensive](https://signoz.io/blog/datadog-pricing/)), sampling rate, and telemetry correlation between traces and logs right from the beginning.

Once the setup is done, you can see your list of [spans](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-span/) and corresponding [flamegraphs](https://signoz.io/blog/flamegraphs/) for your traces. DataDog does a good job of correlating different types of signals. You can relate info from infrastructure, metrics, network, etc., right from trace data if you have those products enabled.

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
  <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/datadog-apm.webp" alt="Datadog APM" />
  <figcaption>
    <i>DataDog's APM showing breakdown of an internal server error</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

**Some of the key features of DataDog APM include:**

- ✅ Distributed tracing to track requests from user sessions to services and databases.
- ✅ Correlation of distributed traces to infrastructure and network metrics.
- ✅ Ingest 100% of traces from the last 15 minutes with retention of error and high latency traces.
- ✅ Code-level performance inspection and breakdown of slow requests.

### New Relic APM

New Relic's traces page shows trace groups instead of a list of spans, which feels like a cleaner representation, and you can filter by root spans, which comes in handy in case of large trace groups.

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
  <img
    className="box-shadowed-image"
    src="/img/blog/2024/02/new-relic-apm.webp"
    alt="New Relic APM"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <i>New Relic groups spans in trace groups and shows important metrics about them.</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

You can get flamegraphs for your traces in New Relic, too. Compared to DataDog, New Relic has fewer options for correlation. But it is interesting to note that New Relic shows many more spans for the same call in my Java application.

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
  <img
    className="box-shadowed-image"
    src="/img/blog/2024/02/new-relic-traces.webp"
    alt="New Relic Traces"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <i>New Relic's Flamegraph view of traces - you can also check out corresponding logs</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

**Some of the key features of New Relic APM include:**

- ✅ Auto-instrumentation of eight programming languages: Java, .Net, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, and C/C++
- ✅ Distributed tracing and sampling options for a wide range of technology stacks
- ✅ Correlation of tracing data with other aspects of application infrastructure and user monitoring
- ✅ Fully managed cloud-native experience with on-demand scalability

### Verdict: New Relic vs DataDog

Overall, if you need a simpler experience, then choose New Relic's APM. But if you need more control over what things you can do with your data, then choose DataDog's APM.

Let's dive deeper into the specific features and performance of New Relic vs DataDog in the next sections.

## Log Management: DataDog for More Filters, New Relic for Quick-Start

### New Relic Log Management

New Relic automatically collected logs from my Java application and displayed them in the logs tab. It allows you to search logs using Lucene, an open-source search library, and query log data using NRQL, a SQL-like query language developed by New Relic.

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
  <img
    className="box-shadowed-image"
    src="/img/blog/2024/02/new-relic-log-management-dashboard.webp"
    alt="Log Management Dashboard in New Relic"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <i>Log Management Dashboard in New Relic showing logs from instrumented Java application</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

**Key features of New Relic's log management:**

- Automatically extracts attributes from logs.
  <figure data-zoomable align="center">
    <img
      className="box-shadowed-image"
      src="/img/blog/2024/02/new-relic-log-attributes.webp"
      alt="Log Attributes in New Relic"
    />
    <figcaption>
      <i>Attributes filtered from Java application logs in New Relic</i>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
- Provides a feature called patterns for log data discoverability, though it didn't detect any pattern in my Java application logs.
- Tools to manage log data by optimizing storage with dropping filters.

### DataDog Log Management

For DataDog, automatic log collection is disabled by default and needs to be enabled in the agent's config file, along with activating a Java integration for application logs collection.

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
  <img
    className="box-shadowed-image"
    src="/img/blog/2024/02/datadog-logs-tab.webp"
    alt="Log Tab in Datadog"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <i>Log Tab in DataDog showing logs from my Spring Boot Application</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Both DataDog and New Relic offer log pattern detection, but DataDog identified patterns in my logs, while New Relic did not. DataDog provides more options to filter and visualize log data and allows the use of cloud storage for logs, useful for long-term storage.

Setting up log collection in DataDog took more time compared to New Relic, but DataDog offers more visualization options.

### Verdict: New Relic vs DataDog

If you need a quick-start log management system, New Relic is the better choice with its automatic log collection and easy setup. However, if you require more control over filtering and visualizing logs, DataDog's log management provides more advanced options.

## Infrastructure Monitoring: Tie, Decide Based on Cost

Host monitoring in both DataDog and New Relic is good, and choosing one over the other can be a matter of personal choice. I personally like the color theme of New Relic and the representation of things like disk usage in a table.

### DataDog Infrastructure Monitoring

What's interesting about DataDog is that it showed me a glimpse of the JVM metrics dashboard while clicking on my host. DataDog has done a really good job at correlating different types of information collected from your application and host.

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
  <img
    className="box-shadowed-image"
    src="/img/blog/2024/02/datadog-infrastructure.webp"
    alt="Datadog infrastructure tab"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <i>Datadog showing JVM metrics without any configuration was a good experience</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
  <img
    className="box-shadowed-image"
    src="/img/blog/2024/02/datadog-infrastructure-2.webp"
    alt="Datadog host monitoring dashboard"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <i>Datadog's dashboard for host monitoring</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Some of the key features of DataDog's infrastructure monitoring include:

- ✅ You can see all your machines in the infrastructure list. Each machine/host has tags, aliases, and metrics attached to it.
- ✅ DataDog provides a Host map to visualize all your hosts on one screen.
- ✅ It also provides a container map and real-time monitoring of containers.

### New Relic Infrastructure Monitoring

New Relic's infrastructure monitoring provides robust features for connecting host performance with configuration changes.

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
  <img
    className="box-shadowed-image"
    src="/img/blog/2024/02/new-relic-host-monitoring.webp"
    alt="New Relic Host Monitoring Dashboard"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <i>New Relic's Dashboard for Host monitoring</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Some of the key features of New Relic infrastructure monitoring include:

- ✅ Connect changes in your host performance with your configuration changes.
- ✅ Troubleshoot performance issues by connecting the server-side to the application side if your infrastructure account is connected with the APM account.
- ✅ Provides integrations to collect metrics for popular platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, etc.

### Verdict: New Relic vs DataDog

If your use case is only infrastructure monitoring, then the decision comes down to cost. However, it's not easy to figure out how much each tool will cost on a head-to-head basis as their pricing structures are very different. I recommend you sign up and do a trial for both tools, including factors like user seats (New Relic charges for user seats).

## Network Monitoring

### DataDog Network Monitoring

DataDog offers robust network monitoring capabilities. Some of the key features include:

- ✅ Provides metrics for point-to-point communication within your infrastructure.
- ✅ Granular data for network flows in a multi-cloud environment with aggregation capabilities supported by tags.
- ✅ Automatically collects tags from more than 450 integrations, allowing you to see network volume between any two sets of tags.

### New Relic Network Monitoring

New Relic provides comprehensive network monitoring solutions. Some of the key features include:

- ✅ Pre-configured dashboards for monitoring popular cloud services like Azure, AWS, and GCP, with dynamic alerting.
- ✅ Integrations with over 100 services, including advanced Kubernetes monitoring that correlates metrics from the application and the infrastructure. Check the full list of [AWS](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/), [Azure](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/), and [GCP](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/) integrations.

### Verdict: New Relic vs DataDog Network Monitoring

Both DataDog and New Relic offer strong network monitoring features. DataDog excels in granular data and multi-cloud environments, while New Relic shines with its pre-configured dashboards and extensive integrations. The choice between the two may come down to specific needs and preferences regarding integration and visualization capabilities.

## Browser or Real-User Monitoring

Real User Monitoring (RUM) is critical for understanding actual end-user experience with your applications. Both platforms offer robust solutions but with different approaches.

### DataDog Real-User Monitoring

DataDog provides comprehensive end-to-end visibility into user journeys for mobile and web applications. Some of the key features include:

- ✅ Session Replay with up to 30-day retention, allowing you to watch recordings of user sessions
- ✅ Capture and track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) with the ability to set alerts
- ✅ Detailed filtering by user attributes, device, geography, and other dimensions
- ✅ Strong integration with backend APM traces for full-stack visibility
- ✅ Root cause analysis for slow loading times with visibility into code, network, and infrastructure
- ✅ Customer segmentation using tags for real-time error tracking

DataDog's RUM provides powerful analytics but requires additional configuration to enable all features, and it's priced per session.

### New Relic Browser Monitoring

New Relic monitors end-users using your application across web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. Some of the key features include:

- ✅ Quick implementation with automatic tracking of "four golden signals" of user experience
- ✅ Built-in Apdex scoring for user satisfaction measurement
- ✅ Event trails and breadcrumbs (though no full session video replay)
- ✅ Full-stack visibility to identify end-user latency from backend or network issues
- ✅ Session performance heatmaps showing user interaction with the webpage
- ✅ JavaScript error analytics to track end-user steps leading to errors

New Relic's approach is simpler to implement and provides core functionality out-of-the-box, though it lacks some advanced features like session replay that Datadog offers.

### Verdict: New Relic vs DataDog Browser Monitoring

If you need detailed user behavior insights with session replay and fine-grained analysis, Datadog RUM is more powerful. If you prefer quick implementation of essential UX monitoring with minimal setup, New Relic's Browser Monitoring provides what most teams need. Both capture Core Web Vitals and integrate with backend monitoring.

## Synthetic Monitoring

Synthetic monitoring simulates user interactions to proactively detect issues before real users encounter them. Both platforms offer comprehensive solutions in this area.

### New Relic Synthetics

New Relic Synthetics provides various monitor types including:

- ✅ Simple pings and API tests to check availability
- ✅ Scripted browser interactions for complex user flows
- ✅ Broken link detection and SSL certificate checks
- ✅ Geographically distributed testing from multiple locations
- ✅ Private locations for monitoring internal applications
- ✅ SLA/SLO tracking with over 300 optimization recommendations

New Relic Synthetics offers an easy-to-use scripted browser recorder and straightforward dashboards, making it accessible for teams new to synthetic monitoring.

### Datadog Synthetics

Datadog's Synthetic Monitoring supports a wide range of test types:

- ✅ HTTP checks, SSL, DNS, WebSocket, TCP, UDP, ICMP ping, gRPC tests
- ✅ Multistep browser tests with screenshots of simulated sessions
- ✅ Detailed waterfall views for web tests
- ✅ Strong correlation with infrastructure metrics, traces, and logs
- ✅ CI/CD integration for running tests in deployment pipelines
- ✅ Performance budgets for build pass/fail criteria

Datadog excels in providing screenshots and detailed diagnostics when tests fail, as well as supporting lower-level network protocol testing that New Relic doesn't cover.

### Verdict: Synthetic Monitoring

Both platforms offer strong synthetic monitoring capabilities, with Datadog providing more granular test types and CI/CD integration, while New Relic offers excellent out-of-the-box scenarios and SLA reporting. Your choice might depend on whether you need specific protocol checks (advantage Datadog) or prefer simpler setup for web app testing (advantage New Relic).

## Security Monitoring

Security observability has become increasingly important, and the two platforms differ significantly in this area.

### Datadog Security Monitoring

Datadog has invested heavily in security observability with a comprehensive suite of products:

- ✅ Cloud SIEM for log-based threat detection
- ✅ Cloud Workload Security for host/container protection
- ✅ Application Security Management for runtime protection
- ✅ Cloud Security Posture Management for configuration security
- ✅ Real-time threat detection analyzing logs, metrics, and traces
- ✅ Integration with user data from authentication systems
- ✅ Customizable detection rules with severity levels

Datadog's approach brings observability data into the security realm, enabling robust DevSecOps capabilities, though these features come at additional cost.

### New Relic Security Features

As of 2025, New Relic's security monitoring capabilities are still developing:

- ✅ Vulnerability management (in public preview)
- ✅ Security Health views
- ✅ Basic security events integration
- ✅ Limited security insights in the same dashboards as performance data

New Relic is beginning to integrate security signals into its observability platform, but lacks a dedicated security monitoring product comparable to Datadog's offerings.

### Verdict: Security Monitoring

Datadog is the clear winner for security monitoring in 2025. Its comprehensive suite covers cloud and application security extensively. New Relic currently doesn't offer comparable security monitoring features, so organizations requiring integrated security visibility typically either extend New Relic with third-party tools or consider Datadog for that domain.

## Cloud-Native & Kubernetes/Serverless

Modern infrastructure heavily leverages cloud-native architectures, and both platforms have invested in supporting these paradigms.

### Datadog Cloud-Native Capabilities

Datadog's infrastructure heritage gives it strong Kubernetes monitoring:

- ✅ Dedicated Datadog Cluster Agent for Kubernetes
- ✅ Auto-discovery of containerized services
- ✅ Integration with Kubernetes Events for deployment changes
- ✅ Live container maps and detailed resource metrics
- ✅ First-class support for AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions
- ✅ Serverless monitoring with cold start tracking and cost visibility
- ✅ 800+ integrations covering cloud-native tools

Datadog's extensive integrations and purpose-built components for container and serverless environments make it particularly strong for complex cloud-native architectures.

### New Relic Cloud-Native Capabilities

New Relic has made significant advances in Kubernetes monitoring:

- ✅ "One-step Kubernetes observability" for automatic instrumentation
- ✅ Kubernetes integration and on-cluster agent (Pixie)
- ✅ Kubernetes cluster explorer views
- ✅ Native OpenTelemetry data support
- ✅ AWS Lambda monitoring via Lambda layer
- ✅ Distributed tracing through serverless functions
- ✅ Instrumentation for multiple serverless platforms

New Relic focuses on simplifying Kubernetes monitoring by instrumenting both applications and the platform in one step, with an emphasis on ease of use rather than raw depth.

### Verdict: Cloud-Native

Both platforms are well-suited for cloud-native environments. Datadog may be preferable for organizations that are all-in on infrastructure monitoring at massive scale with fine-tuned control. New Relic fits teams that want to instrument applications running on Kubernetes or serverless with minimal effort. The choice often depends on which platform you're already using and whether you need Datadog's extra cloud-security features.

## Pricing: Beware of These Things

Both DataDog and New Relic use different pricing models, which can significantly impact your total cost.

### New Relic

New Relic uses a usage-based pricing model centered on users and data ingest:

- **Users:** Three tiers of users:
  - Full Platform Users (~$99/user/month)
  - Core Users (~$49/user/month) 
  - Basic Users (free)
- **Data Ingest:** 100GB of free data per month, then pay per GB (~$0.25/GB)
- **Entity-based pricing:** No per-host or per-CPU charges
- **Perpetual free tier:** Good for evaluation and small projects
- **Pricing Gotchas:** User seats can get expensive (Full users), and ingesting huge log volumes beyond the free tier adds up quickly

New Relic's pricing is often more predictable for smaller usage and encourages broad monitoring since you're not penalized per host.

### DataDog

DataDog uses a modular, per-product pricing structure:

- **Infrastructure Monitoring:** ~$15 per host/month
- **APM & Continuous Profiler:** ~$31 per host/month
- **Logs:** ~$0.10/GB ingestion + separate retention costs
- **RUM:** ~$1.50 per 1,000 sessions
- **Synthetics:** Priced per test run
- **Security Products:** Add-on pricing (SIEM, workload security, etc.)
- **Custom Metrics:** Additional charges beyond standard metrics
- **Pricing Gotchas:** Complex SKU-based pricing makes forecasting difficult; custom metrics can dramatically increase costs; using all components on all hosts gets very expensive

DataDog's granular pricing allows you to pay only for what you use, but requires discipline and careful management to avoid surprises.

### Verdict: Pricing

If you want a predictable pricing model with many hosts but moderate data volumes, New Relic might be simpler and possibly cheaper. If you want to pay only for specific features on specific hosts and can limit usage carefully, Datadog can be cost-optimized but requires discipline. Large enterprises that negotiate custom contracts may find either workable, but Datadog is generally perceived as more expensive, while New Relic offers better bang-for-buck upfront but watch for data overages.

## OpenTelemetry Support: Not Great in Both Datadog & New Relic

OpenTelemetry is quietly emerging as the open-source standard for collecting all types of telemetry signals. There are numerous [benefits](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-use-cases/#opentelemetry-vs-vendor-based-agents-for-application-instrumentation) to using OpenTelemetry for collecting telemetry data from your applications and host.

Both Datadog's and New Relic's support for OpenTelemetry is [not up to the mark](https://signoz.io/blog/is-opentelemetry-a-first-class-citizen-in-your-dashboard-a-datadog-and-newrelic-comparison/), which seems reasonable as their entire product is anchored around their specific agents.

For example, Datadog cannot link traces and logs automatically with the [DataDog OpenTelemetry](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-vs-datadog/) tools. New Relic's documentation is better for using OpenTelemetry, but once the data gets reported, you can see the difference again.

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
  <img

    src="/img/blog/2023/09/firsclass-6.webp"
    alt="OpenTelemetry data in New Relic"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <i>OpenTelemetry data is segregated in New Relic and not included in the APM experience.</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

If you are looking to use OpenTelemetry, then I would recommend [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) (of course) - an OpenTelemetry-native APM. And just like OpenTelemetry, SigNoz is also open-source. So you can have a full-stack open-source observability stack with SigNoz and OpenTelemetry.

## User Experience

### DataDog User Experience

DataDog offers a powerful but complex user interface with extensive customization options. The interface provides a lot of flexibility with multiple menus, time scopes, and tag-based filtering on nearly every screen.

Key aspects of the Datadog UI:
- ✅ Extremely detailed dashboards with many visualization options
- ✅ Powerful dashboard layout editor for custom views
- ✅ Deep integration between different data types
- ❌ Can be overwhelming for newcomers with many features in submenus
- ❌ Navigation sometimes feels cluttered with many related features bundled together
- ❌ Steeper learning curve, especially for the query syntax

Advanced users appreciate the granular control, but new users often find the interface challenging until they gain experience.

### New Relic User Experience

New Relic underwent a UI redesign in mid-2023, creating a cleaner, more intuitive interface. The platform organizes features in a straightforward way with clear navigation categories.

Key aspects of the New Relic UI:
- ✅ User-friendly interface with guided onboarding
- ✅ NRQL query builder for easy data exploration
- ✅ Both click-driven exploration and deep query options
- ✅ Dark mode with consistent visual design
- ✅ Logical organization of features
- ❌ Fewer customization options than Datadog
- ❌ Some settings can be hard to find initially

New Relic excels at guiding users through setup and exploration, making the platform more approachable, though it might have fewer advanced options than Datadog.

### Verdict: New Relic vs DataDog

New Relic wins on overall ease-of-use and intuitive design, especially for new users or smaller teams. Datadog provides a feature-rich interface preferred by power users who invest time to learn it. If you value a clean UI that onboards you smoothly, New Relic has an edge; if you need fine-grained control and don't mind density, Datadog works well once mastered.

## Datadog vs New Relic: Final Verdict

You should choose Datadog over New Relic if you are an observability expert and want more granular control over your data. That said, New Relic is not far behind in terms of features offered and can be a good solution for application observability.

Here's a use-case-based guide for Datadog vs New Relic:

- If you want better correlation between your signals, choose Datadog.

- If you want comprehensive security monitoring, choose Datadog.

- If you need deep, customizable infrastructure monitoring, choose Datadog.

- If you want a simpler pricing model based on usage, choose New Relic.

- If you prefer quick implementation with minimal learning curve, choose New Relic.

- If your team is application-centric (developers focused on APM), choose New Relic.

- If you need a free tier or more cost-effective startup pricing, choose New Relic.

Both platforms are excellent, but they cater to slightly different priorities. Datadog excels in depth and power across infrastructure, security, and customization, while New Relic offers a more unified experience with faster time-to-value, especially for application-centric teams.

## Issues with existing monitoring vendors

DataDog and New Relic are great monitoring tools and provide a gamut of monitoring products that any organization can use. But these enterprise monitoring tools can have the following issues:

- Crazy node-based pricing
  Node-based pricing doesn't make sense in today's micro-services architecture. Any node which is live for more than 8hrs in a month is charged. So, unsuitable for spiky workloads

- Very costly
  These tools are very costly if you want to do things like sending custom metrics.

- Cloud-only
  Hence, not suitable for companies that have concerns with sending data outside their infra

- Closed product roadmap
  For any small feature, you are dependent on their roadmap. We think this is an unnecessary restriction for a product which developers use. A product used by developers should be extendible

### What the Community is Saying about New Relic vs DataDog

Reddit users have shared their experiences with Datadog and New Relic, highlighting various issues and insights:

- **Pricing Transparency and Cost Issues**:
  Users often mention the unpredictable billing and high costs associated with both Datadog and New Relic.

- Out-of-the-box charts for application metrics like p90, p99, latency, error rates, request rates, etc.
- Distributed tracing to get end-to-end visibility of your services
- Monitor any metrics important to you, build dashboards for specific use-cases
- Logs Management equipped with a powerful search and filter query builder
- Exceptions monitoring to track exceptions in your application
- Easy to set alerts with DIY query builder
