Monitoring a Kubernetes cluster isn't optional‚Äîit's essential. Without proper observability, identifying performance bottlenecks, debugging failed pods, or understanding system behavior at scale becomes nearly impossible.

In this guide, we've compiled **11 popular Kubernetes monitoring tools**, including open-source, self-hosted, and fully-managed SaaS solutions. For each tool, we'll outline what it's good at, where it may fall short, and ideal use cases.

- [SigNoz (Open-Source)](#signoz--opentelemetry-native-apm)
- [Prometheus (Free)](#prometheus--the-de-facto-standard-for-metrics)
- [Grafana (Open-Source)](#grafana--the-visualization-powerhouse)
- [EFK Stack](#efk-stack--the-powerful-logging-solution-for-kubernetes)
- [Datadog](#datadog--comprehensive-monitoring-for-kubernetes-and-beyond)
- [New Relic + Pixie](#new-relic--pixie-all-in-one-observability-for-kubernetes)
- [Dynatrace](#dynatrace--ai-powered-full-stack-observability-for-kubernetes)
