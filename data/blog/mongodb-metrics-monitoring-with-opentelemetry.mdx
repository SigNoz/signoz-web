For high throughput systems that focus on gathering continuous data or have a heavy read-only traffic, NoSQL databases came as a blessing. NoSQL databases, due to their unstructured nature of data, allow relatively faster inserts as well as reads compared to relational databases. One such database that’s quite popular today is MongoDB. In this article, our focus would be to understand how to extract metrics out of MongoDB and ship them to Signoz using the Open Telemetry collector.

## A Brief Overview of MongoDB

First released in early 2009, MongoDB is one of the most popular NoSQL databases in use today. MongoDB practically made the concept of NoSQL more popular. As of today, MongoDB is available as a community edition database and a licensed database for use similar to MySQL and PostgreSQL in the relational database world.

MongoDB is known for its high throughput for the insertion of records and, hence, is generally utilized for systems that have high insertions or reads expected primarily for unstructured data. This nature of usage makes it necessary to monitor MongoDB to ensure that it performs at its best and is scaled as needed.

## A Brief Overview of OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, SDKs, libraries, and integrations aiming to standardize the generation, collection, and management of telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces). It is backed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and is the leading open-source project in the observability domain.

The data you collect with OpenTelemetry is vendor-agnostic and can be exported in many formats. Telemetry data has become critical in observing the state of distributed systems. With microservices and polyglot architectures, there was a need to have a global standard. OpenTelemetry aims to fill that space and is doing a great job at it thus far.

In this tutorial, you will use OpenTelemetry Collector to collect MongoDB metrics for performance monitoring.

### What is OpenTelemetry Collector?

OpenTelemetry Collector is a stand-alone service provided by OpenTelemetry. It can be used as a telemetry-processing system with a lot of flexible configurations to collect and manage telemetry data.

It can understand different data formats and send it to different backends, making it a versatile tool for building observability solutions.

[Read our complete guide on OpenTelemetry Collector](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-collector-complete-guide/)

## How does OpenTelemetry Collector collect data?

A receiver is how data gets into the OpenTelemetry Collector. Receivers are configured via YAML under the top-level `receivers` tag. There must be at least one enabled receiver for a configuration to be considered valid.

Here’s an example of an `otlp` receiver:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:
```

An OTLP receiver can receive data via gRPC or HTTP using the <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/docs/specification.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OTLP</a> format. There are advanced configurations that you can enable via the YAML file.

Here’s a sample configuration for an otlp receiver.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: "localhost:4318"
        cors:
          allowed_origins:
            - http://test.com
            # Origins can have wildcards with *, use * by itself to match any origin.
            - https://*.example.com
          allowed_headers:
            - Example-Header
          max_age: 7200
```

You can find more details on advanced configurations <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/otlpreceiver/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[OTLP](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/otlpreceiver/README.md)</a>.

After configuring a receiver, **you must enable it**. Receivers are enabled via pipelines within the service section. A pipeline consists of a set of receivers, processors, and exporters.

The following is an example pipeline configuration:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, prometheus]
      exporters: [otlp, prometheus]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp, jaeger]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp, zipkin]
```

Now that you understand how OpenTelemetry collector collects data, let’s see what MongoDB metrics can be collected.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have the Opentelemetry collector installed on the same host as your database if you plan to monitor a local database.

### Preparing MongoDB database setup

For the purpose of this tutorial, we can use any of the following:

- A local MongoDB installation
- A free/paid hosted service like <a href = "https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MongoDB Atlas</a>
- A docker-compose-based database setup

This section guides you through quick database setup using <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/engine/install" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker</a> and <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/compose" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker-Compose</a>.

This would help you get rid of any technical challenges related to setting up the agent or database locally. The below links can help you with the Docker installation:

- <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker Desktop for Linux</a>
- <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker Desktop for Mac (macOS)</a>
- <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker Desktop for Windows</a>

Once you have the Docker installation ready to go, create the below `docker-compose.yaml` file. Note that the `mongodbreceiver` as of today, supports only v4.0+ and v5.x. Thus, we will be using the initial stable release of v5.

```bash
version: '3.8'
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:5.0.22
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: admin
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: password123
    ports:
      - '27017:27017'
    volumes:
      - dbdata6:/data/db
volumes:
  dbdata6:
```

Once done, execute the below command from the same folder to get the MongoDB database server up and running.

```yaml
docker-compose up -d
```

This is a very simple Docker compose file that can spin up MongoDB Database in no time with authentication enabled. It stores the data from MongoDB DB locally in your disk and mounts it onto the container. It makes the database accessible on port 27017 locally.

## Setting up SigNoz

You need a backend to which you can send the collected data for monitoring and visualization. [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is an OpenTelemetry-native APM that is well-suited for visualizing OpenTelemetry data.

SigNoz cloud is the easiest way to run SigNoz. You can sign up [here](https://signoz.io/teams/) for a free account and get 30 days of unlimited access to all features.

You can also install and self-host SigNoz yourself. Check out the [docs](https://signoz.io/docs/install/) for installing self-host SigNoz.

## Setting up OpenTelemetry collector

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers various deployment options to suit different environments and preferences. It can be deployed using Docker, Kubernetes, Nomad, or directly on Linux systems. You can find all the installation options <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.

We are going to discuss the manual installation here and resolve any hiccups that come in the way.

### Step 1 - Downloading OpenTelemetry Collector

Download the appropriate binary package for your Linux or macOS distribution from the OpenTelemetry Collector <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">releases</a> page. We are using the latest version available at the time of writing this tutorial.

For MACOS (arm64):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fOL https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.90.0/otelcol-contrib_0.90.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
```

### Step 2 - Extracting the package

Create a new directory named `otelcol-contrib` and then extract the contents of the archive into this newly created directory with the following command:

```yaml
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.90.0_darwin_arm64.tar -C otelcol-contrib
```

### Step 3 - Setting up the configuration file

Create a config.yaml file in the otelcol-contrib folder. This configuration file will enable the collector to connect with MongoDB and have other settings like at what frequency you want to monitor the instance.

<Admonition>
The configuration file should be created in the same directory where you unpack the `otel-collector-contrib` binary. In case you have globally installed the binary, it is ok to create on any path.
</Admonition>

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: localhost:4317
      http:
        endpoint: localhost:4318
  mongodb:
    hosts:
      - endpoint: localhost:27017
    username: <root-username>
    password: <root-password>
    collection_interval: 30s
    initial_delay: 30s
    tls:
      insecure: true
      insecure_skip_verify: true
processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 1000
    timeout: 10s
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443" # replace {region} with your region
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "{signoz-token}" # Obtain from https://{your-signoz-url}/settings/ingestion-settings
  logging:
    verbosity: detailed
service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      address: localhost:8888
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, mongodb]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

You would need to replace `region` and `signoz-token` in the above file with the region of your choice (for Signoz Cloud) and token obtained from Signoz Cloud → Settings → Ingestion Settings.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/common/ingestion-key-details.webp" alt="You can find ingestion details in the SigNoz dashboard"/>
    <figcaption><i>You can find ingestion details in the SigNoz dashboard</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Additionally, replace the MySQL username and password as well. In case you are using the `docker-compose` based setup, the username will be `root`, and the password will be `password123`.

The above configuration is quite simple - Whenever you wish to monitor a different remote self-hosted database (other than MongoDB Atlas), all you would need to change is `endpoint` url for the `mongodbreceiver`. You can also monitor multiple MongoDB servers by adding multiple receivers as shown below:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: localhost:4317
      http:
        endpoint: localhost:4318
  mongodb:
    hosts:
      - endpoint: localhost:27017
    username: <root-username>
    password: <root-password>
    collection_interval: 30s
    initial_delay: 30s
    tls:
      insecure: true
      insecure_skip_verify: true
  mongodb/2:
    hosts:
      - endpoint: <remote-url>:27017
    username: <root-username>
    password: <root-password>
    collection_interval: 30s
    initial_delay: 30s
    tls:
      insecure: true
      insecure_skip_verify: true
processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 1000
    timeout: 10s
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443" # replace {region} with your region
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "{signoz-token}" # Obtain from https://{your-signoz-url}/settings/ingestion-settings
  logging:
    verbosity: detailed
service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      address: localhost:8888
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, mongodb, mongodb/2]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### Step 4 - Running the collector service

Every Collector release includes an `otelcol` executable that you can run. Since we’re done with configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command.

From the `otelcol-contrib`, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

If you want to run it in the background -

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$\!" > otel-pid
```

### Step 5 - Debugging the output

If you want to see the output of the logs, we’ve just set up for the background process. You may look it up with:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```

tail 50 will give the last 50 lines from the file `otelcol-output.log`

You can stop the collector service with the following command:

```yaml
kill "$(< otel-pid)"
```

You should start seeing the metrics on your Signoz Cloud UI in about 30 seconds.

## Monitoring with Signoz Dashboard

Once the above setup is done, you will be able to access the metrics in the SigNoz dashboard. You can go to the Dashboards tab and try adding a new panel. You can learn how to create dashboards in SigNoz [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards-and-panels/).

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you installed an OpenTelemetry Collector to collect MongoDB metrics and sent the collected data to SigNoz for monitoring and alerts.

Visit our [complete guide](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-collector-complete-guide/) on OpenTelemetry Collector to learn more about it. OpenTelemetry is quietly becoming the world standard for open-source observability, and by using it, you can have advantages like a single standard for all telemetry signals, no vendor lock-in, etc.

SigNoz is an open-source [OpenTelemetry-native APM](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-apm/) that can be used as a single backend for all your observability needs.
