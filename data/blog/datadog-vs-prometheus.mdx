**Deployment:** Datadog is a cloud-based SaaS solution, meaning there's no need to install or maintain any infrastructure. Simply sign up, install the Datadog Agent on your infrastructure, and begin sending metrics and logs to the platform.

**Data Collection:** Datadog can collect data from a myriad of sources using integrations. These pre-built connectors allow data collection from specific technologies or platforms. Custom integrations are also supported.

#### Prometheus:

**Deployment:** Being open-source, Prometheus requires manual download and installation on your infrastructure. It comprises various components, including the Prometheus server, exporters, and client libraries.

**Data Collection:** Prometheus uses exporters to collect data. An exporter exposes metrics in a format that Prometheus can scrape. Numerous exporters are available for different technologies.

### Features - Datadog has much more to offer

#### Datadog:

**Data Visualization:** Offers a plethora of visualization tools, including dashboards, graphs, and maps. Custom visualizations are also supported.

**Real-time Monitoring:** Provides real-time monitoring through metrics, logs, and traces. [Distributed tracing](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-in-microservices/) is available to track individual request performance.

**Search Capabilities:** A robust search interface with various filters and operators. Anomaly detection using machine learning identifies unusual data patterns.

**Machine Learning:** Features like anomaly detection and forecasting are driven by machine learning. Custom ML models can also be built.

### Pricing - Prometheus is free(but has infra costs), Datadog can blow up bills

#### Datadog:

Offers a free trial. Post-trial, users can opt for various paid plans based on data volume and feature requirements. Plans are categorized into Essential, Pro, and Enterprise tiers.

But you need to ask [whether getting Datadog is worth it or not](https://signoz.io/blog/justifying-a-million-dollar-observability-bill/).

#### Prometheus:

Being open-source, it's free to download and use. However, associated costs might arise from hosting and maintaining the necessary infrastructure.

## Key Features of DataDog

DataDog is an enterprise SaaS tool that offers an array of services in the monitoring domain. Some of the key features of the DataDog monitoring platform includes:

- **Log Management**<br></br>
  DataDog offers scalable log ingestion and analytics through its log management product. You can search, filter, and analyze log data through its dashboard. You can route all your logs from one central control panel.

- **Application performance monitoring**<br></br>
  DataDog's APM tool provides end-to-end distributed tracing from frontend devices to databases. You can connect the collected traces to infrastructure metrics, network calls, and live processes.

- **Security monitoring**<br></br>
  Using DataDog security monitoring, you can analyze operational and security logs in real-time. It provides built-in threshold and anomaly detection rules to detect threats quickly.

- **Network monitoring**<br></br>
  With DataDog network monitoring, you can analyze traffic as it flows across applications, containers, availability zones, and on-premise servers. You can track key network metrics like TCP retransmits, latency, and connection churn.

- **Real user monitoring**<br></br>
  With DataDog's real user Monitoring, you can have end-to-end visibility into user journeys for web and mobile applications.

## Key Features of Prometheus

Prometheus was initially developed at SoundCloud in 2012 before being released as an open-source project. It got accepted into the CloudNative Computing Foundation in 2016 and was the second project to graduate from the foundation, following Kubernetes.

Prometheus enables you to capture time-series data as metrics. These metrics can be aggregated to give insights into the behavior of our systems.

Some of the key features of Prometheus metrics monitoring are:

- **Multi-dimensional data model**
  Prometheus stores data as time-series. For example, it can store time-stamped values of the total number of HTTP requests received. You can also store an optional set of key-value pairs called labels for that metric. The multi-dimensional data model enables rich contextual metrics monitoring. Notation of time-series metrics:

  ```jsx
  <metric name>{<label name>=<label value>, ...}
  ```

- **Flexible query language**<br></br>
  Prometheus provides a query language called PromQL. Using PromQL, you can filter and aggregate metrics data in real-time.

- **Pull model data collection**<br></br>
  In contrast to most APM tools, Prometheus data collection is pull-based. It requires you to run an HTTP server that exposes Prometheus metrics.

- **Alert manager**<br></br>
  You can use a rules.yml file to set alerts for critical issues. You need to install the alert manager to get useful notifications from Prometheus. It has some cool features like grouping alerts into one notification and silencing alerts for a period of time.

- **Visualization layer**<br></br>
  The visualization layer of Prometheus is basic, but it can be combined with Grafana - another open-source web visualization tool to create rich visualizations of monitoring data.
