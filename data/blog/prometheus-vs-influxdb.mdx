Prometheus and InfluxDB are open-source projects created to make application performance monitoring a breeze. That is, of course, if you choose the option that covers your entire observability scope.

![Cover Image](/img/blog/2022/07/prometheus_vs_influxdb.webp)

This article compares and contrasts the extent to which Prometheus and InfluxDB remedy the need for real-time insights into your applications’ operations. We’ll highlight similarities and overlaps in both usability and practicality.

Typically, every reader’s choice ultimately depends on their use case. As such, the knowledge we’ll expose you to should help you make informed choices on which tool works best.

## What are Prometheus and InfluxDB?

**Prometheus** is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. It's designed for reliability and scalability, making it a go-to choice for many DevOps teams. Prometheus collects and stores metrics as time series data, allowing for powerful querying and alerting capabilities.

**InfluxDB**, on the other hand, is a purpose-built time series database. It offers both open-source and commercial options, providing flexibility for different use cases. InfluxDB excels at handling high write and query loads, making it suitable for various monitoring and analytics scenarios.

Both tools have their roots in the need for better monitoring solutions in modern, distributed systems:

- Prometheus was developed by SoundCloud in 2012 and became a standalone open-source project in 2015.
- InfluxDB was created by InfluxData in 2013, aiming to provide a scalable solution for time series data.

Primary use cases for these systems include:

- Prometheus: Metrics-based monitoring, especially in cloud-native and microservices environments.
- InfluxDB: Time series data storage and analysis, including IoT sensor data, application metrics, and financial trading data.

## A Crash Course to Prometheus

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2022/07/prometheus_image.webp" alt="Prometheus"/>
</figure>


First deployed for open use by <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, <a href = "https://prometheus.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Prometheus</a> is a package of system monitoring and event alerting tools. Since 2016, it's been a part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (<a href = "https://www.cncf.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CNCF</a>.) The same governance body for other revolutionary tools, such as the <a href = "https://kubernetes.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Kubernetes project</a>.

A typical Prometheus instance execution exposes a time-series model multi-dimensional database. It binds metrics and key/value arrays. The metrics data stored can be rendered in easy-to-evaluate visualizations through the default <a href = "https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/browser/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Expression Browser</a>. But Prometheus provides a basic visualization layer. It is often teamed up with Grafana, an open-source data visualization tool to create richer dashboards.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2022/07/prometheus_architecture.webp" alt="Prometheus architecture"/>
    <figcaption><i>Prometheus Architecture and Ecosystem (Source: Prometheus Docs)</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Currently, data streams from the instrumentation of Prometheus' various <a href = "https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">client libraries</a> are converted into time series models and formats. However, plans are underway to reveal system insights in an assortment of metric options:

- **Gauge** - This is the metric type typically responsible for fluctuating readings on dashboards. For example, where resource usage (compute, storage, etc.) varies over time. So a gauge metric would suffice to push metrics for effective observability.

- **Counter** - A metric that exposes a quality that only increases (positive count or reset). A good application area would be showing how many times an application has been visited over an observed duration.

- **Summary** - In addition to the counter metric's ability, a summary exposes the intensity of an observed event. This facilitates comparative analysis of metrics, especially when they emerge from multiple telemetry collection sources/edges.

- **Histogram** - Much like the summary metric, histogram metrics show a multi-variable sample result. They further group output into bars over the duration of observation. This facilitates comparative analysis of metrics. Especially when they emerge from multiple telemetry collection sources/edges.

## InfluxDB 101 - A Crash Course

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2022/07/influxdb_image.webp" alt="Influxdb"/>
</figure>


Available as an open-source tool, alongside a paid distribution of the same, InfluxDB provides a time-series data platform. InfluxDB is a capable time-series engine with a wide range of application areas. It’s designed to ingest and process multiple data points ingesting anything from metrics, traces, logs, and events.

InfluxDB was penned in Go, backed by the Y Combinator accelerator initiative, and officially deployed for public access in 2013 by then Errplane (now InfluxData).

InfluxDB comes filled to the brim with tools that facilitate the full range of data manipulation activity spectrum. These include:

- A CLI (<a href = "https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.3/telegraf-configs/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Telegraf</a>) that is used to streamline read and write tasks from the actual data storage location. It comes in handy across all hosting options, cloud, local, and hybrid.

- Querying and processing data from InfluxDB instances is made possible through the use of either InfluxQL or the proprietary Flux language, solely created for data scripting. With some practice, low-code end users can configure and schedule complex tasks through the InfluxDB UI to process data into valuable insights.

- Monitoring and notifying users when triggers go off. With a variety of endpoints (Slack, email, HTTP, etc.), admins/analysts can keep tabs on environment variable statuses or simple event occurrences stored in the time series engine. This gives them the edge to react quickly and maintain optimal system performance when notifications chime.

- Multiple <a href = "https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.3/visualize-data/visualization-types/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">visualization options</a> become the go-to window for enhanced visibility into systems once all APIs and client libraries have been configured correctly.

## Key Similarities Between Prometheus and InfluxDB

Apart from their key intentions being congruent, the most obvious commonality is that **both are OSS**. This means you could get away with using either, or both platforms at no cost. While this is a good way to onboard and prove their effectiveness on your projects, it also means you'd be using the very base of their distros.

Once they fetch telemetry data, they spit out **compatible data types**. Being multi-dimensional time-series data storage engines, you could create a pipeline including both Prometheus and InfluxDB to squeeze the most value from every byte of data extracted through query-based results or any logs trickling in from live applications.

One implemented both Prometheus and InfluxDB platforms' performance can be extended through plugins. Plugins add functionality above and beyond the collectors and extractors crucial to fetching and provisioning telemetry data.

## Key Differences: InfluxDB vs. Prometheus

Despite being clearly useful for application performance monitoring, InfluxDB and Prometheus approach their objectives differently. To start with, they use different query languages (InfluxQL and PromQL) to explore underlying data pools.

### Flux and FluxQL At A Glance

Flux is the official querying language for a vast array of operations in InfluxDB. Depending on the actual task at hand, InfluxQL will resemble the regular SQL most developers are familiar with.

```jsx
join(
tables: {mem:memUsed, proc:procTotal},
on: ["_timestamp", "_halt", "_begin", "host"],
)
```

Take, for instance, a data transformation operation above, which looks and writes like regular SQL at first glance.

### Typical PromQL Commands

Prometheus implements its own command language for data operations - PromQL. We'll use the same join function to demonstrate the difference in syntax.

```jsx
label_join(up{job="api-server",src1="a",src2="b",src3="c"}, "foo", ",", "src1", "src2", "src3")
```

Although we have condensed the code above to just a single sentence, this is not to imply relative ease of use. Code density and complexity will vary depending on prior scripting experience and the scope of operations underway.

Also, all snippets of code above are extracts from the official <a href = "https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#trigonometric-functions" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PromQL</a> and <a href = "https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.3/query-data/flux/join/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">InfluxQL</a> scripting documentation volumes.

Even the way time-series data is kept in data engines is different. Approaches to data storage (append-only vs. in-memory indexing and time structured merge trees). In addition to this disparity, the degree of accuracy for event timestamps is more precise within InfluxDB compared to Prometheus time-series stores.

Although both tools are OSS projects, InfluxDB also has a paid tier offering a fully-managed experience hosted in the cloud. InfluxDB also offers an enterprise-grade user-managed version. Prometheus is free unless you decide to use distros hosted by cloud services providers (AWS, GCP, AZURE, etc.).

## Key Features of Prometheus vs InfluxDB

Understanding the core features of both systems is essential for making the right choice. Let's break down the key differences:

### Data Model

Prometheus uses a multi-dimensional data model. Each time series is identified by a metric name and a set of key-value pairs called labels. This model allows for flexible and efficient querying across different dimensions.

Example Prometheus metric:

```
http_requests_total{method="POST", endpoint="/api/users"}
```

InfluxDB employs a tag-based data model. Data points consist of measurements, tag sets, and field sets. This model provides a good balance between flexibility and performance.

Example InfluxDB data point:

```
measurement,tag1=value1,tag2=value2 field1=value1,field2=value2 timestamp
```

### Query Language

Prometheus uses PromQL (Prometheus Query Language), a powerful and flexible language designed specifically for time series data. PromQL allows for complex aggregations and calculations across multiple time series.

PromQL example:

```
rate(http_requests_total{method="GET"}[5m])
```

InfluxDB uses InfluxQL, which is similar to SQL, making it familiar to many developers. It also supports Flux, a more powerful scripting language for complex data transformations.

InfluxQL example:

```sql
SELECT mean("value") FROM "cpu" WHERE "host" = 'server01' GROUP BY time(10s)
```

### Scalability and Clustering

Prometheus is designed for vertical scalability. It doesn't natively support clustering, but you can use federation or remote storage adapters for horizontal scaling.

InfluxDB offers built-in clustering in its commercial version, allowing for easier horizontal scaling out of the box.

### Retention Policies and Data Management

Both systems provide ways to manage data retention:

- Prometheus uses a local storage engine with configurable retention periods.
- InfluxDB offers more granular control with retention policies that can be set per measurement or database.

### Visualization Capabilities

Both Prometheus and InfluxDB integrate well with Grafana, a popular open-source visualization tool. This allows you to create rich, interactive dashboards for your metrics.

Prometheus provides a basic built-in expression browser for ad-hoc queries and graph exploration. InfluxDB offers Chronograf, part of the TICK stack, for native visualization.

Creating dashboards in Grafana with either system is straightforward:

1. Add your Prometheus or InfluxDB data source in Grafana.
2. Create a new dashboard and panels.
3. Use PromQL or InfluxQL to query your data.
4. Customize your visualizations with Grafana's rich set of options.

## Performance and Scalability

Performance is a critical factor when choosing a monitoring tool. Here's how Prometheus and InfluxDB stack up:

### Write and Read Performance

- Prometheus excels at read performance, making it great for querying and alerting.
- InfluxDB is optimized for high write throughput, handling millions of data points per second.

### Horizontal Scaling

- Prometheus relies on functional sharding for horizontal scaling. You divide your metrics across multiple Prometheus servers.
- InfluxDB Enterprise offers native clustering, allowing for easier distribution of data across multiple nodes.

### High Availability

- Prometheus achieves high availability through running multiple identical Prometheus servers and using Alertmanager for deduplication.
- InfluxDB Enterprise provides built-in replication and automatic failover.

### Resource Consumption

- Prometheus is generally more resource-efficient for smaller to medium-sized deployments.
- InfluxDB may require more resources but offers better performance for very large datasets.

## Data Collection and Storage

The way data is collected and stored can significantly impact your monitoring architecture:

### Data Collection Methods

- Prometheus uses a pull-based model. It scrapes metrics from configured targets at regular intervals.
- InfluxDB uses a push-based model. Applications or agents send data to InfluxDB directly.

### Storage Efficiency

Both systems use efficient storage formats:

- Prometheus uses a custom time series database format optimized for append-only writes and range queries.
- InfluxDB uses a Time-Structured Merge Tree (TSM) storage engine, providing high write and read throughput.

### Data Retention and Downsampling

- Prometheus allows you to configure retention periods and uses a block-based storage for efficient data management.
- InfluxDB offers continuous queries and retention policies for automatic downsampling and data expiration.

### Backup and Recovery

- Prometheus provides snapshot-based backups of its time series database.
- InfluxDB offers more comprehensive backup and restore functionality, including incremental backups.

## Use Cases: When to Choose Prometheus or InfluxDB

Choosing between Prometheus and InfluxDB often depends on your specific use case:

### Ideal Scenarios for Prometheus

- Cloud-native environments using Kubernetes
- Microservices architectures requiring service discovery
- When you need powerful alerting capabilities out of the box

### Situations Where InfluxDB Excels

- IoT and sensor data collection with high write throughput
- Long-term data retention and historical analysis
- When you need a flexible, general-purpose time series database

### Considerations for Mixed Environments

In some cases, you might use both:

- Prometheus for real-time monitoring and alerting
- InfluxDB for long-term storage and complex analytics

### Industry-Specific Recommendations

- Finance: InfluxDB for high-frequency trading data
- E-commerce: Prometheus for real-time performance monitoring
- Manufacturing: InfluxDB for sensor data, Prometheus for process monitoring

## Integration and Ecosystem

A robust ecosystem can make or break your monitoring solution:

### Prometheus Ecosystem

- Grafana: Excellent support for both as data sources
- Ansible/Chef/Puppet: Modules available for automated deployment

### Community Support and Resources

- Prometheus: Large, active open-source community with extensive documentation
- InfluxDB: Strong community support, with additional resources from InfluxData

## Conclusion: How To Select a monitoring tool

When all is said and done, one should ensure the closer fit of either Prometheus or InfluxDB to their specific monitoring requirements. Given how you can use InfluxDB to scrape data from Prometheus' collector endpoints when doing custom instrumentation, it might be worthwhile experimenting with their paired use to get the best experience.

Better still, when your application metrics monitoring scope is considerably large, going back to the fundamentals can be the way to go. Metrics are just one aspect of monitoring your application for performance issues. Today’s distributed applications need a combination of metrics, logs, and traces to debug performance issues quickly.

For that you can explore OpenTelemetry based full-stack APM, [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/). With SigNoz you can monitor metrics and track transactions across services with [distributed tracing](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-in-microservices/). There are other features like exceptions monitoring, custom dashboards, and alerts too.
