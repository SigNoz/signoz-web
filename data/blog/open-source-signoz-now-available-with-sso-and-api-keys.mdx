One of the biggest asks from our open-source community has been to open-source our SSO support, which was part of our enterprise offering. Today, we’re thrilled to announce that support for **SSO with Google OAuth is now part of our latest release.**

Latest version: [v0.85.0](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.85.0)

Not only that, we've also shipped another highly anticipated feature for our Community Edition: **API Keys for comprehensive programmatic access to SigNoz.**

For a long time, the ask for these features in our Community Edition has resonated loudly within our user base. We've been listening, and we're incredibly proud to deliver on these requests, empowering more users to experience a seamless, secure, and integrated observability experience with SigNoz.

Let’s dig deeper into these features.

## A Unified and Secure Experience: SSO with Google OAuth

The top request from our community has been the ability to integrate SigNoz with existing identity providers for a smoother login experience.

We are delighted to bring **Single Sign-On (SSO) with Google OAuth** to the SigNoz Community Edition. This means you can now leverage your existing Google Workspace credentials to securely and conveniently log in to your SigNoz instance. This not only streamlines the login process but also enhances security by centralising authentication.

While previously available only in our Cloud and Enterprise [plans](https://signoz.io/pricing/), this powerful feature is now fully available for everyone using the Community Edition. Getting started is straightforward, and you can find detailed instructions in our updated documentation.

Support for additional OAuth providers will be added soon, with plans to make it fully configurable for all users.

## API Keys for programmatic access to your SigNoz data

For those looking to automate workflows, integrate SigNoz with their existing tools, or build custom applications on top of SigNoz data, we are introducing comprehensive **API Keys** for the SigNoz Community Edition.

API Keys empower you to integrate SigNoz seamlessly into your operational workflows, manage configurations, and automate tasks. For example, with API keys, you can programmatically:

- **Create and Manage Alerts:** Define, update, and manage alert rules to align with your operational needs.
- **Create Scheduled Downtimes:** Programmatically schedule maintenance windows to suppress alerts during planned work, reducing alert fatigue.
- **Manage Dashboards/Alerts with Terraform:** With API keys now available in the Community Edition, self-hosted users gain the ability to manage SigNoz resources like dashboards and alerts directly using a Terraform provider.

Our open-source users can build powerful workflows based on their specific needs.

*Reference:* For specific API endpoints, see the [SigNoz API Reference](https://signoz.io/api-reference/#/).

## Our Commitment to the Community

Just like our launch of the SigNoz Single Binary, these new additions to the Community Edition deliver on our promise of democratising observability for all. We believe that powerful observability tools should be accessible to everyone, and these features are a direct result of community feedback to make open source observability accessible to everyone.

Feel free to share your feedback with GitHub [issues](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz) or open a [discussion](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/discussions).

We're incredibly excited to see how you leverage these new capabilities to further enhance your observability strategies. These features will enable anyone using SigNoz community edition have access to top grade observability.

**Thank you for being an integral part of the SigNoz journey!**
