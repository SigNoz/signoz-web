## Why Teams Look for Splunk Alternatives

Despite Splunk's powerful capabilities, organizations are increasingly seeking alternatives due to several key challenges:

### 1. Vendor Lock-in
Splunk's proprietary formats and agents create significant barriers to migration, limiting flexibility and potentially increasing long-term costs.

### 2. High Infrastructure Costs
Splunk requires substantial computing resources and storage (2-3× ingestion volume), making scaling prohibitively expensive, even in cloud deployments.

### 3. Performance Issues
At high data volumes, indexing lags and search performance degrades without extensive query optimization, causing delayed insights.

### 4. Complex Scaling
Petabyte-scale deployments demand specialized expertise and continuous tuning, with configurations that work at smaller scales often failing at larger ones.

### 5. Cloud Limitations
Splunk's cloud offering typically underperforms compared to on-premises deployments, with slower historical searches and more complicated integrations with internal systems.
