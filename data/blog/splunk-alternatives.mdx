## Splunk Usecases

Let's briefly discuss these use cases:

- **Log Management**
  As a log management tool, it collects and indexes logs from your application. This way, you can quickly search, analyze, and visualize log data in real time. The major importance of Splunk logs is to enable you to identify patterns, insights, and trends and troubleshoot issues faster.
- **Security Analysis**
  Splunk monitors and analyze security-related data. This mainly includes analyzing network traffic and system logs to detect and respond to potential security threats. This helps organizations meet compliance requirements by providing visibility into security-related data and tracking user activity.
- **Application Performance**
  Traffic data allows Splunk to monitor the performance of applications. Splunk collects traffic, page load times, and user engagement data. This allows you to identify performance bottlenecks and improves the user experience where needed.
- **Network infrastructure monitoring
  S**plunk monitors network-related issues such as network traffic, device performance, and availability. This allows you to identify and diagnose issues within your network infrastructure.

Splunk has many use cases. However, there are some situations where you might consider using Splunk alternatives.

## When not to use Splunk

Let's discuss scenarios that you would like to explore the Splunk alternatives:

- **Scale** - Splunk is designed for large machine-generated datasets. A basic log management and analysis tool would be ideal for analyzing and monitoring smaller data volumes.
- **Cost constraints** - Splunk's advanced capabilities can be costly to set up and maintain. Therefore, exploring other Splunk alternatives, especially when you have limited resources, is good to ensure a cost-effective approach.
- **Limited technical expertise** - Tools such as Splunk may require certain technical expertise to set up and maintain their advanced features and use cases. Without such necessary expertise, you can consider solutions that are easier to use and require less technical skill.

<a href = "https://www.elastic.co/logstash/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Logstash</a> is an open-source data collection tool with real-time capabilities. It provides an easy-to-build pipeline for collecting data from different sources.

It's part of the Elastic Stack (ELK). Logstash lets you collect, parse and transform data. You can then send the data to multiple destinations. These destinations include Elasticsearch, a search and analytics engine, log management and analysis tools, databases, monitoring systems, etc.

Like Splunk, Logstash collects data from various sources, such as log files, system metrics, and network traffic. It then processes that data using a variety of filters. These filters can be used to extract, transform, and simplify the data into a more structured format to make it easier to search and analyze.

However, they have key differences in terms of their functionality and architecture that you can consider choosing Logstash over Splunk. For example:

- Logstash is open-source and free to use. Thus a cost-effective alternative.
- It is part of the Elastic Stack ecosystem.
- Platform-agnostic for portability capabilities making it easier to run it on platforms of your choice.
- Seamless integration with other tools such as Elasticsearch, Kibana, Grafana, and Prometheus.
- Customization flexibility as its plugin system allows you to create customization and extension that meets your data inputs, outputs, and processing options.
