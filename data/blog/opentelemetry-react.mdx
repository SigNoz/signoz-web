OpenTelemetry can be used to trace React applications for performance issues and bugs. You can trace user requests from your frontend web application to your downstream services. OpenTelemetry is an open-source project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (<a href="https://www.cncf.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CNCF</a>) that aims to standardize the generation and collection of telemetry data.

Using OpenTelemetry Web libraries, you can instrument your React apps to generate tracing data. You can track user requests from your frontend web application to your downstream services.

Before we demonstrate how to implement the OpenTelemetry libraries, let's have a brief overview of OpenTelmetry.

## What is OpenTelemetry and Why Use it in React Applications?

<a href="https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry</a> is an open-source vendor-agnostic set of tools, APIs, and SDKs used to instrument applications to create and manage telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces). It aims to make telemetry data a built-in feature of cloud-native software applications.

The telemetry data is then sent to an observability tool for storage and visualization.

<figcaption><i>OpenTelemetry libraries instrument application code to generate telemetry data that is then sent to an observability tool for storage & visualization</i></figcaption>
</figure>

OpenTelemetry is the bedrock for setting up an observability framework. It also provides you the freedom to choose a backend analysis tool of your choice.

For React applications, it offers several key benefits:

1. **Standardized data collection**: OpenTelemetry uses a consistent format for traces, metrics, and logs, making it easier to analyze data across different parts of your application.
2. **Vendor-agnostic approach**: You're not locked into a specific monitoring tool; OpenTelemetry data can be exported to various backends.
3. **Comprehensive visibility**: It allows you to track both frontend and backend performance, providing a holistic view of your application.
4. **Performance optimization**: With detailed metrics and traces, you can identify and resolve bottlenecks in your React components.

By implementing OpenTelemetry in your React application, you gain a powerful toolkit for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing your user experience.

## Understanding OpenTelemetry Components for React

To effectively use OpenTelemetry in React, you need to understand its core components:

1. **Traces**: These represent the journey of a request through your application. In React, a trace might include component rendering, API calls, and state updates.
2. **Metrics**: Quantitative data about your application's performance. For React, this could include render times, component mount/unmount durations, or custom business metrics.
3. **Logs**: Textual records of events in your application. While React doesn't have built-in logging, you can integrate custom logs with OpenTelemetry.
4. **OpenTelemetry SDK**: This is the library you'll use to instrument your React application. It provides APIs for creating spans, recording metrics, and managing context.
5. **OpenTelemetry Collector**: An optional component that receives, processes, and exports telemetry data. It's particularly useful for handling data from both frontend and backend services.
6. **Exporters**: These send your telemetry data to your chosen backend system for analysis and visualization.

Understanding these components will help you effectively implement OpenTelemetry in your React projects.

## OpenTelemetry and SigNoz

In this article, we will use [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) as our backend analysis tool. SigNoz is a full-stack open-source APM tool that can be used for storing and visualizing the telemetry data collected with OpenTelemetry. It is built natively on OpenTelemetry and works on the OTLP data formats.

SigNoz provides query and visualization capabilities for the end-user and comes with out-of-box charts for application metrics and traces.

Now let's get down to how to implement OpenTelemetry Web libraries and then visualize the collected data in SigNoz.

## Running React application with OpenTelemetry

### Step 1: Install SigNoz or SetUp SigNoz Cloud

First, you need to install SigNoz so that OpenTelemetry can send the data to it.

<GetStartedSigNoz />

SigNoz can be installed on macOS or Linux computers in just three steps by using a simple install script.

The install script automatically installs Docker Engine on Linux. However, on macOS, you must manually install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker Engine</a> before running the install script.

```bash
git clone -b main <https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git>
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh

```

You can visit our documentation for instructions on how to install SigNoz using Docker Swarm and Helm Charts.

<Figure src="/img/blog/2024/09/opentelemetry-react-deploy_docker_documentation.webp" alt="" caption="" />When you are done installing SigNoz, you can access the UI at <a href="http://localhost:3301/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://localhost:3301</a>

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
<img src="/img/blog/common/signoz_dashboard_homepage.webp" alt="SigNoz dashboard"/>
<figcaption><i>SigNoz dashboard - It shows services from a sample app that comes bundled with the application</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Step 2: Get sample React app

[Sample React App](https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-reactjs-app/tree/master)<br></br>
It contains the sample boilerplate code that we will instrument.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SigNoz/sample-reactjs-app.git

```

### Step 3: Enable CORS in the OTel Receiver

Enable CORS in the OTel Receiver. Under SigNoz folder, open the `otel-collector-config.yaml` file. The file is located at `deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/otel-collector-config.yaml`

You can view the file at [SigNoz GitHub repo](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/develop/deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/otel-collector-config.yaml). Inside the file add the following CORS config:

```go
http:
  cors:
    allowed_origins:
      - <https://netflix.com>  # URL of your Frontend application

```

You need to update the URL in the config file to match your frontend application URL. For this tutorial, we will be running our frontend application on `http://localhost:3000`.

```go
http:
  cors:
    allowed_origins:
      - <http://localhost:3000>

```

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
<img src="/img/blog/2023/03/enable_cors.webp" alt="Setting frontend UI port number"/>
</figure>

Once you make the changes, you need to restart the Docker containers.

**To stop SigNoz cluster:**

Run it under `/signoz/deploy` folder at your terminal:

```
sudo docker compose -f docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml stop

```

**To start/resume SigNoz cluster:**

Run it under `/signoz/deploy` folder at your terminal:

```
sudo docker compose -f docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml up

```

<Admonition>
The stopped SigNoz cluster should resume and mount to the existing docker volumes._
</Admonition>

### Step 4: Instrument React app with OpenTelemetry

To instrument the React app with OpenTelemetry, we need to install the OpenTelemetry dependencies.

```bash
yarn add -D @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/context-zone @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http @opentelemetry/instrumentation-fetch

```

### Step 5: Update Service Name and CollectorTrace Exporter

The file is located at `src/helpers/tracing/index.ts`, in the sample react app codebase.

```jsx
const serviceName = "sample-react-app";
const resource = new Resource({ "service.name": serviceName });
const provider = new WebTracerProvider({ resource });
const collector = new CollectorTraceExporter({
  url: "<http://localhost:4318/v1/traces>",
});

```

### Step 6: Start the React app

Go to the root folder of your React application, and run the following command:

```go
yarn start
```

Congratulations! You have successfully run your React application with OpenTelemetry. It's time to see the collected data.

### Step 7: Generate some data

In order to monitor your React application with SigNoz, you first need to generate some data.

Visit <a href="http://localhost:3000/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/</a> to access your frontend application. Using the UI, make some calls to the backend API. You can check the network tab in your browser to see the requests that you have made.

## Optimizing React Performance with OpenTelemetry Insights

OpenTelemetry data can be invaluable for optimizing your React application's performance. Here are some strategies:

1. **Identify slow-rendering components**: Analyze your component render time metrics to find components that take longer to render.
2. **Optimize re-renders**: Use the render count metrics to identify components that are re-rendering unnecessarily. Consider using `React.memo` or `useMemo` to optimize these components.
3. **Improve load times**: Use distributed tracing to identify slow API calls or resource loads that are impacting your application's initial load time.
4. **Monitor user interactions**: Create custom spans for important user interactions to ensure they're performing well.

## Conclusion

Using OpenTelemetry Web libraries, you can instrument your frontend applications for end-to-end tracing. You can then use an open-source APM tool like SigNoz to ensure the smooth performance of your React applications.

OpenTelemetry is the future for setting up observability for cloud-native apps. It is backed by a huge community and covers a wide variety of technology and frameworks. Using OpenTelemetry, engineering teams can instrument polyglot and distributed applications with peace of mind.
