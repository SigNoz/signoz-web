Instrumentation is the biggest challenge engineering teams face when starting out with monitoring their application performance. <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry</a> is the leading open-source standard that is solving the problem of instrumentation. It is currently an incubating project under the <a href = "https://www.cncf.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>.

It is a set of tools, APIs, and SDKs used to instrument applications to create and manage telemetry data(Logs, metrics, and traces). It aims to make telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces) a built-in feature of cloud-native software applications.

One of the biggest advantages of using OpenTelemetry is that it is vendor-agnostic. It can export data in multiple formats which you can send to a backend of your choice.

In this article, we will use [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) as a backend. SigNoz is an open-source APM tool that can be used for both metrics and distributed tracing.

Let's get started and see how to use OpenTelemetry for a Flask application.

## Running a Flask application with OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is a set of tools, APIs, and SDKs used to instrument applications to create and manage telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces).

### Setting up SigNoz

You need a backend to which you can send the collected data for monitoring and visualization. [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is an OpenTelemetry-native APM that is well-suited for visualizing OpenTelemetry data.

SigNoz cloud is the easiest way to run SigNoz. You can sign up [here](https://signoz.io/teams/) for a free account and get 30 days of unlimited access to all features.

You can also install and self-host SigNoz yourself. Check out the [docs](https://signoz.io/docs/install/) for installing self-host SigNoz.

### Instrumenting a sample Flask application with OpenTelemetry

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.8 or newer<br></br>
   Download the <a href = "https://www.python.org/downloads/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >latest version</a> of Python.
- MongoDB<br></br>
   Below are the download links for different OS:<br></br>
   <a href = "https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >MacOS</a><br></br>
   <a href = "https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Linux</a><br></br>
   <a href = "https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Windows</a><br></br>
   <a href = "https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Ubuntu</a><br></br>

**Step 1. Running sample Flask app**<br></br>

We will be using the Flask app at this <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-flask-app" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Github repo</a>. All the required OpenTelemetry packages are contained within the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-flask-app.git
cd sample-flask-app
```

It’s a good practice to create virtual environments for running Python apps, so we will be using a virtual python environment for this sample Flask app.

#### Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Check if the app is running
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```
You can now access the UI of the app on your local host: http://localhost:5002/

    <figcaption><i>Sample flask application running on local host</i></figcaption>
</figure>

To capture data with OpenTelemetry, you need to configure some environment variables and run the app with OpenTelemetry packages. Once you ensure your app is running, stop the app with `ctrl + c` on a mac. Now, let us instrument the sample app with OpenTelemetry packages.

**Step 2. Run instructions for sending data to SigNoz**<br></br>
The `requirements.txt` file contains all the necessary OpenTelemetry Python packages needed for instrumentation. In order to install those packages, run the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<Admonition type="info">
The opentelemetry-exporter-otlp is a convenience wrapper package to install all OTLP exporters. Currently, it installs:

- opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http

- opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc

- (soon) opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-json-http

The `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc` package installs the gRPC exporter which depends on the `grpcio` package. The installation of `grpcio` may fail on some platforms for various reasons. If you run into such issues, or you don't want to use gRPC, you can install the HTTP exporter instead by installing the `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http` package. You need to set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` environment variable to `http/protobuf` to use the HTTP exporter.
</Admonition>


**Step 3. Install application-specific packages**<br></br>

This step is required to install packages specific to the application. Make sure to run this command in the root directory of your installed application. This command figures out which instrumentation packages the user might want to install and installs it for them:

```bash
opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
```

<Admonition>
Please make sure that you have installed all the dependencies of your application before running the above command. The command will not install instrumentation for the dependencies which are not installed.
</Admonition>

**Step 4. Configure environment variables to run app and send data to SigNoz**<br></br>

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name> \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
opentelemetry-instrument <your_run_command>
```

- `<service_name>` is the name of the service you want
- `<your_run_command>` can be python3 app.py or flask run
- Replace SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY with the api token provided by SigNoz. You can find it in the email sent by SigNoz with your cloud account details.

You will be able to get ingestion details in SigNoz cloud account under settings --> ingestion settings.

</figure>


<Admonition>
Don’t run app in reloader/hot-reload mode as it breaks instrumentation. For example, if you use `--reload` or `reload=True`, it enables the reloader mode which breaks OpenTelemetry isntrumentation.
</Admonition>

For our sample Flask application, the run command will look like:

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=flask-app \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
opentelemetry-instrument python app.py
```

And, congratulations! You have instrumented your sample Flask app. You can check if your app is running or not by hitting the endpoint at [http://localhost:5002/](http://localhost:5002/).

You need to interact with the application to generate some monitoring data. 

Below you can find your `flask-app` in the list of applications being monitored on SigNoz dashboard.

    <figcaption><i>Flask app in the list of applications monitored by SigNoz</i></figcaption>
</figure>


### Troubleshooting

The debug mode can break instrumentation from happening because it enables a reloader. To run instrumentation while the debug mode is enabled, set the use_reloader option to False:

```bash
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5002, debug=True, use_reloader=False)
```

If you face any problem in instrumenting with OpenTelemetry, refer to [these docs](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/python).

## Monitor Flask application with SigNoz

SigNoz makes it easy to visualize metrics and traces captured through OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

SigNoz comes with out of box RED metrics charts and visualization. RED metrics stands for:

- Rate of requests
- Error rate of requests
- Duration taken by requests

    <figcaption><i>Measure things like application latency, requests per sec, error percentage and see your top endpoints with SigNoz</i></figcaption>
</figure>


You can then choose a particular timestamp where latency is high to drill down to traces around that timestamp.
