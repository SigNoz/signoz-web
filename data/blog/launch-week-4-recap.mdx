OpenTelemetry is rapidly becoming the backbone of modern observability, but true innovation happens when you build directly on its latest capabilities. For Launch Week 4.0, we’re excited to showcase five powerful features; each crafted to help you get more value from your telemetry, make debugging faster, and deliver a unified observability experience. 

Here’s a quick look at what’s new, why it matters, and how SigNoz is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with OTel.

## Deep Temporal Observability

Get a complete view of your Temporal workflows-metrics, traces, and logs-all correlated in one place. Instantly filter by workflow, activity, or worker, and jump from a metric spike to the exact trace or log you need. No more context switching or manual correlation.

## Metrics Explorer

Discover and analyze every metric flowing into your stack with a real-time, searchable overview. Spot high-cardinality metrics, filter and group by service or endpoint, and build dashboards or alerts right from the explorer. No more guessing what’s being collected.

## Third-Party API Monitoring

Automatically visualize and monitor every external API your system calls. See error rates, latency, and throughput for each dependency, and correlate third-party performance with your internal traces. Quickly answer, “Is it us, or is it them?”

## CI/CD Observability

Bring observability to your CI/CD pipelines. With OTel’s CI/CD semantic conventions, you can now track build and deploy durations, flaky steps, and bottlenecks; then correlate pipeline health with production incidents, all in one place.

## Tracing Funnels

Define funnels between any two or more spans in your distributed system and instantly measure conversion rates, errors, and latency between steps. Funnel analysis for distributed traces is now a reality. Pinpoint where requests drop off or slow down in complex workflows.
