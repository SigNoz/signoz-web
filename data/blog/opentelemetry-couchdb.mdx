Before that, letâ€™s have a brief overview of CouchDB.

If you want to jump straight into implementation, start with this [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

## A Brief Overview of CouchDB

CouchDB stores data in documents, which are like digital files. This makes it easy to organize and manage information. Unlike some databases that need a strict structure, CouchDB lets you change and adapt your data without any hassle. It's like having a tool that can handle different shapes and sizes of information.

CouchDB is simple to use. You don't need complicated setups or confusing rules. It's like the easy-to-use librarian for your data. It can grow with your needs. As your programs or applications get bigger, CouchDB can handle more data without slowing down. CouchDB can easily adjust to changes in how your data is organized. This means you can improve and update your programs without causing a lot of trouble for your database.

**Why CouchDB Matters:**

CouchDB serves as the backbone of your data-driven applications, providing a reliable foundation for information management. Unlike traditional databases, CouchDB excels in handling unstructured data, offering flexibility that developers appreciate.

## A Brief Overview of OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, SDKs, libraries, and integrations aiming to standardize the generation, collection, and management of telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces). It is backed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and is the leading open-source project in the observability domain.

The data you collect with OpenTelemetry is vendor-agnostic and can be exported in many formats. Telemetry data has become critical in observing the state of distributed systems. With microservices and polyglot architectures, there was a need to have a global standard. OpenTelemetry aims to fill that space and is doing a great job at it thus far.

In this tutorial, you will use OpenTelemetry Collector to collect CouchDB metrics for performance monitoring.

## What is OpenTelemetry Collector?

OpenTelemetry Collector is a stand-alone service provided by OpenTelemetry. It can be used as a telemetry-processing system with a lot of flexible configurations to collect and manage telemetry data.

It can understand different data formats and send it to different backends, making it a versatile tool for building observability solutions.

## How does OpenTelemetry Collector collect data?

A receiver is how data gets into the OpenTelemetry Collector. Receivers are configured via YAML under the top-levelÂ `receivers`Â tag. There must be at least one enabled receiver for a configuration to be considered valid.

Hereâ€™s an example of anÂ `otlp`Â receiver:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:
```

An OTLP receiver can receive data via gRPC or HTTP using theÂ <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/docs/specification.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OTLP</a>Â format. There are advanced configurations that you can enable via the YAML file.

Hereâ€™s a sample configuration for an otlp receiver.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: "localhost:4318"
        cors:
          allowed_origins:
            - http://test.com
            # Origins can have wildcards with *, use * by itself to match any origin.
            - https://*.example.com
          allowed_headers:
            - Example-Header
          max_age: 7200
```

You can find more details on advanced configurationsÂ <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/otlpreceiver/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >here</a>.

After configuring a receiver,Â **you must enable it**. Receivers are enabled via pipelines within theÂ serviceÂ section. A pipeline consists of a set of receivers, processors, and exporters.

The following is an example pipeline configuration:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, prometheus]
      exporters: [otlp, prometheus]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp, jaeger]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp, zipkin]
```

Now that you understand how OpenTelemetry collector collects data, letâ€™s see how you can collect CouchDB metrics with OpenTelemetry.

## Prerequisites

**User for OpenTelemetry -** The OpenTelemetry Collector for CouchDB requires select permissions to interact with the database and get stats out of it.

**Open TCP port 5984 -**

In this article, we assume that your CouchDB server and the OpenTelemetry Collector will reside on the same server. If this isn't the case, an additional step is required to open your CouchDB service port, traditionally using port 5984.

The OpenTelemetry Collector for CouchDB communicates with the databases over TCP port 5984. It's crucial to open this port for communication.

<Admonition type="info">
ðŸ’¡ Remember, it's highly advised not to expose this port publicly. Limit access to specific IPs or within a private cloud environment.
</Admonition>

To open TCP port 5984 on a Linux server, utilize the following command:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 5984/tcp
```

If you're implementing a firewall for your VMs to manage inbound traffic, ensure that port **`5984`** is allowed there as well.

Once these preparations are complete, you're ready to proceed with installing and running the OpenTelemetry Collector for CouchDB.

## Setting up SigNoz

You need a backend to which you can send the collected data for monitoring and visualization.Â [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/)Â is an OpenTelemetry-native APM that is well-suited for visualizing OpenTelemetry data.

SigNoz cloud is the easiest way to run SigNoz. You can sign upÂ [here](https://signoz.io/teams/)Â for a free account and get 30 days of unlimited access to all features.

You can also install and self-host SigNoz yourself. Check out theÂ [docs](https://signoz.io/docs/install/)Â for installing self-host SigNoz.

## Setting Up OpenTelemetry Collector

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers various deployment options to suit different environments and preferences. It can be deployed using Docker, Kubernetes, Nomad, or directly on Linux systems. You can find all the installation optionsÂ <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >here</a>.

We are going to discuss the manual installation here and resolve any hiccups that come in the way.

### Step 1 - Downloading OpenTelemetry Collector

Download the appropriate binary package for your Linux or macOS distribution from the OpenTelemetry CollectorÂ <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >releases</a>Â page. We are using the latest version available at the time of writing this tutorial.

For MACOS (arm64):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fOL https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.88.0/otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
```

### Step 2 - Extracting the package

Create a new directory namedÂ `otelcol-contrib`Â and then extract the contents of theÂ `otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz`Â archive into this newly created directory with the following command:

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```

### Step 3 - Setting up the Configuration file

Create aÂ `config.yaml`Â file in theÂ `otelcol-contrib`Â folder. This configuration file will enable the collector to connect with CouchDB and have other settings, such as the frequency at which you want to monitor the instance.

TheÂ `config`Â file has a receiver enabled forÂ `hostmetrics`Â too, which will enable you to

Go into the directory:

```bash
cd otelcol-contrib
```

CreateÂ `config.yaml`Â in folderÂ `otelcol-contrib`Â with the below content in it.

```bash
receivers:
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 30s
    scrapers:
      cpu: {}
      disk: {}
      load: {}
      filesystem: {}
      memory: {}
      network: {}
      paging: {}
      process:
        mute_process_name_error: true
        mute_process_exe_error: true
        mute_process_io_error: true
      processes: {}
  couchdb;
		endpoint: "<COUCHDB_URL>:<COUCHDB_PORT>"
		username: <COUCHDB_USERNAME>
		password: <COUCHDB_PASSWORD>
		collection_interval: 15s
processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 1000
    timeout: 10s
  # Ref: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/resourcedetectionprocessor/README.md
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [env, system, ec2] # include ec2 for AWS, gcp for GCP and azure for Azure.
    # Using OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES envvar, env detector adds custom labels.
    timeout: 2s
		override: false
    system:
      hostname_sources: [os] # alternatively, use [dns,os] for setting FQDN as host.name and os as fallback
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443" # replace {region} with your region
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": <SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>
  logging:
    verbosity: detailed
service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      address: localhost:8888
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [couchdb]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics/hostmetrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics]
      processors: [resourcedetection, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

You would need to replace the following details for the config to work properly:

- Endpoint for your CouchDB instance. In place of COUCHDB_URL and port in place of COUCHDB_PORT
- Username & Password of the new user were created in prerequisite steps by replacing COUCHDB_USERNAME & COUCHDB_PASSWORD
- Under exporters, configure theÂ `endpoint`Â for SigNoz cloud along with the ingestion key underÂ `signoz-ingestion-key`. You can find these settings in the SigNoz dashboard.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/common/ingestion-key-details.webp" alt="You can find ingestion details in the SigNoz dashboard"/>
    <figcaption><i>You can find ingestion details in the SigNoz dashboard</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Also, note how we have set up the pipeline in theÂ `service`Â section of the config. We have addedÂ `couchdb`Â in the receiver section of metrics and set the exporter toÂ `otlp`.

### Step 4 - Running the collector service

Every Collector release includes anÂ `otelcol`Â executable that you can run. Since weâ€™re done with configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command.

From theÂ `otelcol-contrib`, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

If you want to run it in the background:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$\!" > otel-pid
```

### Step 5 - Debugging the output

If you want to see the output of the logs, weâ€™ve just set up for the background process. You may look it up with:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```

tail 50 will give the last 50 lines from the fileÂ `otelcol-output.log`

You can check if your service is running successfully by seeing the last log something like -

```bash
2023-11-17T19:33:20.161Z  info  service@v0.88.0/service.go:169  Everything is ready. Begin running and processing data.
```

You can stop the collector service with the following command:

```bash
kill "$(< otel-pid)"
```

## Monitoring with SigNoz Dashboard

Once the above setup is done, you will be able to access the metrics in the SigNoz dashboard. You can go to theÂ `Dashboards`Â tab and try adding a new panel. You can learn how to create dashboards in SigNozÂ [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards-and-panels/).

**Key Terms for Metrics & Attributes**

**Name:**Â The name of the metric is a unique identifier that distinguishes it from other metrics. It helps in referencing and organizing various metrics on SigNoz as well.

**Type:**Â The type of metric defines the kind of data it represents. Common metric types include INT, DOUBLE, STRING, etc.

**Unit:**Â The unit specifies the measurement unit associated with the metric. It helps in interpreting and comparing metric values, including Bytes, NONE, etc.

**Temporality:**Â It involves understanding the temporal patterns and fluctuations within the data, providing insights into how the metric evolves over time. Temporality is crucial for analyzing trends, identifying patterns, and making informed decisions based on the temporal behavior of the observed metric.

**Monotonicity:**Â It refers to the cumulative nature of a metric, indicating that its values continuously increase or remain non-decreasing over time. This property is crucial for tracking cumulative values, such as the total count of events or occurrences.

These are the currently supported metrics at the time the article is written.
