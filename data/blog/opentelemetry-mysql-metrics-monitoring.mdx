## A brief overview of MySQL Database

MySQL is an open-source relational database used by several popular companies around the world. Over the years, it has matured quite well and provides excellent performance even at large scale. Despite this, the tooling provided by the MySQL community is not good enough to monitor the database easily. With a metrics collector like Opentelemetry Collector, we could easily fetch the metrics and publish them to a remote destination like SigNoz to visualize them.

In this tutorial, we will build an end-to-end monitoring solution for MySQL using an <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/mysqlreceiver/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry MySQL receiver</a> to collect the metrics and [Signoz](https://signoz.io) to visualize the collected metrics.

## A Brief Overview of OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, SDKs, libraries, and integrations aiming to standardize the generation, collection, and management of telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces). It is backed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and is the leading open-source project in the observability domain.

The data you collect with OpenTelemetry is vendor-agnostic and can be exported in many formats. Telemetry data has become critical in observing the state of distributed systems. With microservices and polyglot architectures, there was a need to have a global standard. OpenTelemetry aims to fill that space and is doing a great job at it thus far.

In this tutorial, you will use OpenTelemetry Collector to collect MySQL metrics for performance monitoring.

### What is OpenTelemetry Collector?

OpenTelemetry Collector is a stand-alone service provided by OpenTelemetry. It can be used as a telemetry-processing system with a lot of flexible configurations to collect and manage telemetry data.

It can understand different data formats and send it to different backends, making it a versatile tool for building observability solutions.

[Read our complete guide on OpenTelemetry Collector](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-collector-complete-guide/)

## How does OpenTelemetry Collector collect data?

Data collection in OpenTelemetry Collector is facilitated through receivers. Receivers are configured via YAML under the top-level `receivers` tag. To ensure a valid configuration, at least one receiver must be enabled.

Below is an example of an **`otlp`** receiver:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:
```

The OTLP receiver accepts data through gRPC or HTTP in the <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/docs/specification.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OTLP</a> format. There are advanced configurations that you can enable via the YAML file.

Here’s a sample configuration for an OTLP receiver:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: "localhost:4318"
        cors:
          allowed_origins:
            - http://test.com
            # Origins can have wildcards with *, use * by itself to match any origin.
            - https://*.example.com
          allowed_headers:
            - Example-Header
          max_age: 7200
```

You can find more details on advanced configurations <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/otlpreceiver/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.

Once a receiver is configured, it needs to be **enabled** to start the data flow. This involves setting up **pipelines** within a **`service`**. A **pipeline** acts as a streamlined pathway for data, outlining how it should be processed and where it should go. A pipeline comprises of the following:

1. **Receivers:** These are entry points for data into the OpenTelemetry Collector, responsible for collecting data from various sources and feeding it into the pipeline.
2. **Processors:** After data is received, processors manipulate, filter, or enhance the data as needed before it proceeds further in the pipeline. They provide a way to customize the data according to specific requirements.
3. **Exporters:** After processing, the data is ready for export. Exporters define the destination for the data, whether it's an external monitoring system, storage, or another service. They format the data appropriately for the chosen output.

Below is an example pipeline configuration:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, prometheus]
			processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp, prometheus]

```

Here’s a breakdown of the above metrics pipeline:

- **Receivers:** This pipeline is configured to receive metrics data from two sources: OTLP and Prometheus. The **`otlp`** receiver collects metrics using both gRPC and HTTP protocols, while the **`prometheus`** receiver gathers metrics from Prometheus.
- **Processors:** Metrics data is processed using the **`batch`** processor. This processor likely batches metrics before exporting them, optimizing the data flow.
- **Exporters:** Metrics processed through this pipeline can be exported to both OTLP and Prometheus destinations. The **`otlp`** exporter sends data to an endpoint specified in the configuration, and the **`prometheus`** exporter handles the export of metrics to a Prometheus-compatible destination.

## Pre-requisites

This tutorial assumes that the OpenTelemetry Collector is installed on the same host as the MySQL setup.

### Preparing MySQL database setup

For the purpose of this tutorial, we can use a local MySQL setup if you have it installed already. In case you do not have a MySQL database installed already, you can follow the below guide to run the MySQL database locally using <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/engine/install" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker</a> and <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/compose" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker-Compose</a>.

This would help you get rid of any technical challenges related to setting up the agent or database locally. Below links can help you with the Docker installation:

- <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker Desktop for Linux</a>
- <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker Desktop for Mac (macOS)</a>
- <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker Desktop for Windows</a>

Once you have Docker installation ready to go, create the below `docker-compose.yaml` file.

```yaml
version: "3.3"
services:
  mysqldb:
    image: mysql
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: "myoteldb"
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "password123"
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    expose:
      # Opens port 3306 on the container
      - "3306"
      # Where our data will be persisted
    volumes:
      - my-db:/var/lib/mysql
volumes:
  my-db:
```

Once done, execute the below command from the same folder to get the MySQL database server up and running.

```yaml
docker-compose up -d
```

This is a very simple Docker compose file that can spin up MySQL Database in no time. It stores the data from MySQL DB locally in your disk and mounts it onto the container. It makes the database accessible on port 3306 locally.

## Setting up SigNoz

You need a backend to which you can send the collected data for monitoring and visualization. [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is an OpenTelemetry-native APM that is well-suited for visualizing OpenTelemetry data.

SigNoz cloud is the easiest way to run SigNoz. You can sign up [here](https://signoz.io/teams/) for a free account and get 30 days of unlimited access to all features.

You can also install and self-host SigNoz yourself. Check out the [docs](https://signoz.io/docs/install/) for installing self-host SigNoz.

## Setting up OpenTelemetry collector

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers various deployment options to suit different environments and preferences. It can be deployed using Docker, Kubernetes, Nomad, or directly on Linux systems. You can find all the installation options <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.

We are going to discuss the manual installation here and resolve any hiccups that come in the way.

### Step 1 - Downloading OpenTelemetry Collector

Download the appropriate binary package for your Linux or macOS distribution from the OpenTelemetry Collector <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">releases</a> page. We are using the latest version available at the time of writing this tutorial.

For MACOS (arm64):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fOL https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.88.0/otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
```

### Step 2 - Extracting the package

Create a new directory named `otelcol-contrib` and then extract the contents of the `otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz` archive into this newly created directory with the following command:

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```

### Step 3 - Setting up the configuration file

Create a `config.yaml` file in the `otelcol-contrib` folder. This configuration file will enable the collector to connect with MySQL and have other settings, such as the frequency at which you want to monitor the instance.

<Admonition>
The configuration file should be created in the same directory where you unpack the `otel-collector-contrib` binary. In case you have globally installed the binary, it is ok to create on any path.
</Admonition>

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: localhost:4317
      http:
        endpoint: localhost:4318
  mysql:
    endpoint: localhost:3306
    username: <your-root-username>
    password: <your-root-password>
    collection_interval: 10s
    initial_delay: 10s
processors:
  resource/env:
    attributes:
    - key: deployment.environment
      value: staging
      action: upsert
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 1000
    timeout: 10s
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443" # replace {region} with your region
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-access-token": "{signoz-token}" # Obtain from https://{your-signoz-url}/settings/ingestion-settings
  logging:
    verbosity: detailed
service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      address: localhost:8888
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, mysql]
      processors: [resource/env, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

You would need to replace `region` and `signoz-token` in the above file with the region of your choice (for Signoz Cloud) and token obtained from Signoz Cloud → Settings → Integration Settings. The ingestion key details are also available in the SigNoz Cloud dashboard.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2023/11/ingestion-key-details.webp" alt="You can find ingestion details in the SigNoz dashboard"/>
    <figcaption><i>You can find ingestion details in the SigNoz dashboard</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Additionally, replace the MySQL username and password as well. In case you are using the `docker-compose`-based setup, the username will be `root`, and the password will be `password123`.

The above configuration is quite simple - Whenever you wish to monitor a different remote database, all you would need to change is the `endpoint` URL for the `mysql` receiver. You can also monitor multiple MySQL databases by adding multiple receivers, as shown below:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: localhost:4317
      http:
        endpoint: localhost:4318
  mysql:
    endpoint: mysqldb:3306
    username: root
    password: password123
    collection_interval: 10s
    initial_delay: 10s
  mysql/2:
    endpoint: some-remote-database-url:3306
    username: remote-username
    password: secret-password
    collection_interval: 10s
    initial_delay: 10s
processors:
  resource/env:
    attributes:
    - key: deployment.environment
      value: staging
      action: upsert
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 1000
    timeout: 10s
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443" # replace {region} with your region
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-access-token": "{signoz-token}" # Obtain from https://{your-signoz-url}/settings/ingestion-settings
  logging:
    verbosity: detailed
service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      address: localhost:8888
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, mysql, mysql/2]
      processors: [resource/env, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### Step 4 - Running the collector service

Every Collector release includes an `otelcol` executable that you can run. Since we’re done with configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command.

From the `otelcol-contrib`, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

If you want to run it in the background -

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$\!" > otel-pid
```

### Step 5 - Debugging the output

If you want to see the output of the logs, we’ve just set up for the background process. You may look it up with:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```

tail 50 will give the last 50 lines from the file `otelcol-output.log`

You can stop the collector service with the following command:

```yaml
kill "$(< otel-pid)"
```

You should start seeing the metrics on your Signoz Cloud UI in about 30 seconds.

## Monitoring with Signoz Dashboard

Once the above setup is done, you will be able to access the metrics in the SigNoz dashboard. You can go to the Dashboards tab and try adding a new panel. You can learn how to create dashboards in SigNoz [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards-and-panels/).

    <figcaption><i>MySQL metrics collected by OTel Collector and sent to Signoz</i></figcaption>
</figure>


You can easily create charts with [query builder](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/create-a-custom-query/#sample-examples-to-create-custom-query) in SigNoz. Here are the [steps](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-panels/#steps-to-add-a-panel-to-a-dashboard) to add a new panel to the dashboard.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>

    <figcaption><i>Building a chart to monitor the number of queries executed for each operation type</i></figcaption>
</figure>


You can build a complete dashboard around various metrics emitted. Here’s a look at a sample dashboard we built out using the metrics collected.

    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2023/11/mysql_dashboard.webp" alt=""/>
    <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>


You can also create alerts on any metric. Learn how to create alerts [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/alerts-management/).

    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2023/11/mysql_alerts.webp" alt="Creating alerts using a metric panel"/>
    <figcaption><i>Creating alerts using a metric panel</i></figcaption>
</figure>


For instance, as shown above, you could create an uptime alert that quickly updates you if there is any downtime in the database. If you want to get started quickly with MySQL monitoring, you can load this <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/tree/main/mysql" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MySQL JSON</a> in the SigNoz dashboard and get started.

## Reference: MySQL metrics and labels collected by OpenTelemetry

The OpenTelemetry collector receiver connects with your desired MySQL database and gathers the below set of metrics:

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you configured an OpenTelemetry collector to fetch metrics from the MySQL database and visualize them using SigNoz Cloud. You also learned about the variety of MySQL metrics that are available for monitoring.

Visit our [complete guide](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-collector-complete-guide/) on OpenTelemetry Collector to learn more about it. OpenTelemetry is quietly becoming the world standard for open-source observability, and by using it, you can have advantages like a single standard for all telemetry signals, no vendor lock-in, etc.

SigNoz is an open-source [OpenTelemetry-native APM](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-apm/) that can be used as a single backend for all your observability needs.
