> **What is an open source APM tool?**<br></br>
> APM stands for Application Performance Monitoring. APM tools help you to monitor your application for any performance issues. When you opt for an open source APM tool, you get the added advantage of having access to the tool's source code.
> You can host the tool within your infra to adhere to data governance and privacy regulations.


Open source APM tools have added benefits over their SaaS counterparts. Open source tools are more transparent as you can verify its source code, and you can use it without going through the pains of taking approvals usually required for using a third-party vendor tool.

**Benefits of Open Source APM tool over SaaS APM tools:**

- **Customization** - You can customize the tool's source code to suit your needs.

- **Self-hosting** - You don't need to send your data outside your environment. With privacy laws becoming more stringent, this might be the future of APM tools.

- **Data Privacy and control** - When you use a self-hosted open source apm, you don't have to send any data outside your infra. This gives user more control over their data. You don't have to worry about sending any PII data to third party tools.

- **Developer First** - Your org's developers can look under the hood of an open source APM tool. They can decide for themselves whether the tool meets their requirements or not.

- **Community support** - Open source tools have active communities around them. Communities ensure code accountability and support. You can directly influence a product's roadmap by raising GitHub issues.

But first, let's understand what is application performance monitoring and why is it needed?

## What is application performance monitoring(APM)?

Application performance monitoring is the process of keeping your app's health in check. APM tools enable you to be proactive about meeting the demands of your customers. Some of the top metrics that APM tools monitor are application latency, error rate, and requests per second.

## Why is application performance monitoring(APM) needed?

A robust APM tool can provide your engineering teams the much-needed visibility and context into the inner workings of your application. Modern distributed systems have enabled scale at a global scale but at the same time have increased the complexity of an application.

A few essential APM benefits in solving performance issues are as follows:

- Gives a **centralized context and visibility** into the app's inner workings across a distributed system
- Allows you to **proactively identify issues** that can cause breakdown and solves latency issues
- Helps you to **meet end-user expectations** and demands
- **Increase revenue** by protecting against downtime and user churn
- **Saves engineering bandwidth** in debugging and troubleshooting

### Graphite

üåê <a href = "https://graphiteapp.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Website</a>

üíª <a href = "https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >GitHub</a>

Graphite is a time-series monitoring tool that was released in 2008. Graphite consists of three software components:

- **carbon -** a service that listens for time-series data
- **whisper -** a database library for storing time-series data
- **graphite-web -** Graphite's user interface & API for rendering graphs and dashboards

The primary purpose of Graphite is to store numeric time-series data and render graphs of this data. Time-series data is a sequence of data points for a particular metric indexed over time. It can give you insights into the performance of any application, process, or service.

Graphite does not do data collection. Instead, your app needs to be configured to send data to Graphite which passively listens for data using Carbon - a Twisted daemon. Carbon then sends the data to Whisper to store the time-series data to a filesystem.

## How to choose the right open source APM tool for you?

Choosing the right open source APM tool is critical to your team's ability to monitor and troubleshoot issues in your deployed application. If you are going for an open source tool, you must ensure that the tool is being actively developed on GitHub. You can ask yourself the following questions before choosing any open source tool:

- How recent was the last commit made?
- Are the maintainers of the repo responsive?
- How active is the community around the tool?
- Is the tool based on the latest industry-standard components?

But this is just one aspect. Another aspect is whether the tool serves all your needs for application monitoring or not. You don't want your team to manage multiple tools for end-to-end visibility into the performance of your apps.

Logs, metrics, and traces form the three cornerstones of full-stack APM tools. In that scenario, a tool like [SigNoz](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz) can serve all your needs for application monitoring. As the instrumentation is based on OpenTelemetry, you also have the added advantage of not being locked into any product.
