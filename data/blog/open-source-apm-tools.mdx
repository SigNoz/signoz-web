Choosing the right APM tool is critical. How do you know which is the right one for you? Here are the top 13 open-source application performance monitoring(APM) tools that can solve your monitoring needs.

> What is an open source APM tool?<br></br>
APM stands for Application Performance Monitoring. APM tools help you to monitor your application for any performance issues. When you opt for an open source APM tool, you get the added advantage of having access to the tool's source code.
You can host the tool within your infra to adhere to data governance and privacy regulations.
> 

Open-source APM tools have added benefits over their SaaS counterparts. They are more transparent, as you can verify their source code, and you can use them without going through the pains of obtaining approvals usually required for using a third-party vendor tool.

**Benefits of Open-Source APM over SaaS:**

- **Customization:** Tailor the tool's source code to your specific requirements.
- **Self-hosting:** Keep your data within your environment, crucial for data governance and privacy.
- **Data Privacy and Control:** Maintain complete control over your data, avoiding the need to send sensitive information to third parties.
- **Developer First:** Developers gain full visibility into the tool's workings, enabling informed adoption.
- **Community Support:** Benefit from active community support, code accountability, and the ability to influence the product roadmap.

üíª¬†<a href="https://github.com/grafana" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">**GitHub**</a>

Grafana is an open-source data visualization tool. It offers the LGTM+ stack for APM and observability. The key components in the LGTM+ stack are:

> The "LGTM stack" refers to¬†**an observability platform developed by Grafana Labs that comprises Loki, Grafana, Tempo, and Mimir**.
> 

Grafana's observability platform is built on the LGTM stack:

- Loki: An efficient log aggregation system that indexes log metadata, enabling cost-effective storage and fast querying, integrated seamlessly with Grafana.
- Grafana: A versatile visualization tool offering customizable dashboards to display and analyze data from various sources, including metrics, logs, and traces.
- Tempo: A distributed tracing backend focused on scalability, storing and querying trace data, with easy integration into Grafana for visualization.
- Mimir: A long-term, scalable storage system for Prometheus metrics, ensuring high performance and availability for large-scale metric data.

The key challenge of using the LGTM+ stack as an open-source APM is to manage the individual components.

<Figure src="/img/blog/2025/06/open-source-apm-tools-new-relic-vs-grafana-app-observability.webp" alt="Application observability in Grafana" caption="Application observability in Grafana" />

## How to choose the right open source APM tool for you?

Choosing the right open-source APM tool is critical to your team's ability to monitor and troubleshoot issues in your deployed application. If you are going for an open source tool, you must ensure that the tool is being actively developed on GitHub. You can ask yourself the following questions before choosing any open source tool:

- How recent was the last commit made?
- Are the maintainers of the repo responsive?
- How active is the community around the tool?
- Is the tool based on the latest industry-standard components?

But this is just one aspect. Another aspect is whether the tool serves all your needs for application monitoring or not. You don't want your team to manage multiple tools for end-to-end visibility into the performance of your apps.

Logs, metrics, and traces form the three cornerstones of full-stack APM tools. I will ofcourse recommend SigNoz as the tool of choice. It has everything that you will need for end-to-end monitoring of your application & infrastructure. But I hope this list proves helpful in making the right choice for you.
