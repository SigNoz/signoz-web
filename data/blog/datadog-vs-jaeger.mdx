## What is distributed tracing?
In the world of microservices, a user request travels through hundreds of services before serving a user what they need. To make a business scalable, engineering teams are responsible for particular services with no insight into how the system performs as a whole. And that's where distributed tracing comes into the picture.

Distributed tracing gives you insight into how a particular service is performing as part of the whole in a distributed software system. There are two essential concepts involved in distributed tracing: **Spans** and **trace context**.

User requests are broken down into spans.

> What are spans?<br></br>
> Spans represent a single operation within a trace. Thus, it represents work done by a single service which can be broken down further depending on the use case.

A **trace context** is passed along when requests travel between services, which tracks a user request across services. Thus, you can see how a user request performs across services and identify what exactly needs your attention without manually shifting through multiple dashboards.

### Why do we need distributed tracing?

Distributed tracing has become an indispensable practice in modern software development, especially for applications built with microservices or distributed architectures. It offers several key benefits:

- **Root Cause Analysis in Complex Systems:** When a request fails or slows down, distributed tracing allows developers to visualize the entire request path across multiple services. This end-to-end visibility makes it easier to pinpoint the exact service or operation causing the issue, drastically reducing the time it takes to identify and resolve problems.

- **Performance Optimization and Latency Reduction:** By breaking down a request into individual spans, distributed tracing provides detailed timing information for each operation. This helps identify bottlenecks and optimize resource utilization. Teams can focus their efforts on the specific parts of the system that are contributing the most to latency, leading to a better user experience.

- **Understanding Service Dependencies:** In a microservices architecture, services often have complex interactions and dependencies. Distributed tracing provides a clear map of these dependencies, showing how services communicate with each other. This is crucial for understanding the overall system architecture, managing dependencies, and preventing cascading failures.

- **Improved Collaboration and Accountability:** With a shared view of how requests flow through the system, different teams can collaborate more effectively. When an issue arises, it's easier to determine which team is responsible for the service in question, leading to faster resolution and improved accountability.

## Core Differences for Engineers

### Architecture & Deployment: SaaS vs. Self-Hosted

The most fundamental difference is the deployment model, which dictates control, flexibility, and operational load.

- **Datadog** is a **managed SaaS platform**. You install a lightweight agent, and all the complex backend infrastructure for data processing, storage, and analysis is handled by Datadog. This offers a fast setup and low maintenance burden but means your telemetry data is sent to a third-party cloud.

- **Jaeger** is **self-hosted and open-source**. You deploy and manage all components (collectors, storage, UI) on your own infrastructure, whether on-premises or in the cloud. This gives you full control over your data and architecture but requires significant engineering effort to deploy, scale, and maintain. A key update is that **Jaeger v2** is now built on the OpenTelemetry Collector, making it more modular and aligned with modern standards.

### Scope & Features: All-in-One vs. Best-in-Breed

- **Datadog** is a **full-stack observability platform**. Its key strength is correlating data across different signals. You can seamlessly pivot from a slow trace to related host metrics, logs, and even user sessions (RUM) within a single UI. This unified context is powerful for rapid troubleshooting.

- **Jaeger** is a **specialized distributed tracing tool**. It excels at capturing, visualizing, and analyzing traces but does not handle metrics or logs. To get a complete picture, you must integrate it with other tools like Prometheus (for metrics) and Elasticsearch/Loki (for logs), which requires manual effort to correlate data (e.g., by ensuring trace IDs are present in logs).

### Instrumentation & Integration: Turnkey vs. Open Standards

- **Datadog** offers over 500+ turnkey integrations and auto-instrumentation libraries that make data collection easy. While it supports OpenTelemetry, its ecosystem is designed for a seamless experience with its own agents.

- **Jaeger** integrates primarily through **open standards**, specifically OpenTelemetry. This prevents vendor lock-in at the code levelâ€”you can instrument your applications once with OpenTelemetry and send the data to Jaeger or any other compatible backend. This offers flexibility but requires more hands-on configuration than Datadog's plug-and-play approach.

## Pricing Models: The True Cost of Observability

Cost is a critical factor and a major differentiator.

- **Datadog** has a complex, usage-based subscription model. You pay per host, per GB of ingested logs, per million indexed log events, for custom metrics, and more. While powerful, this can lead to unpredictable and high costs at scale, forcing teams to make architectural choices to manage their bills. For a detailed breakdown, check out our guide on [Datadog Pricing](/blog/datadog-pricing).

- **Jaeger** is free, open-source software. The cost is not in licensing but in the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**. This includes the infrastructure (servers, storage) needed to run it and, more importantly, the engineering time required for setup, maintenance, and scaling. At large scale, this TCO can be significantly lower than a Datadog subscription, but it's a trade-off against engineering resources.
