This tutorial discusses how OpenTelemetry can be used to get insights from a Java application.

## What is OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry is an open-source collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs that aims to standardize the way we generate and collect telemetry data. It follows a specification-driven development. The <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry specification</a> has design and implementation guidelines for how the instrumentation libraries should be implemented. In addition, it provides client libraries in all the major programming languages that follow the specification.

OpenTelemetry was formed after the merger of two open-source projects - OpenCensus and OpenTracing in 2019. Since then, it has been the go-to open-source standard for instrumenting cloud-native applications.

The specification is designed into distinct types of telemetry known as signals. Presently, OpenTelemetry has specifications for these three signals:

- Logs
- Metrics and
- Traces

Together, these three signals form the three pillars of observability. OpenTelemetry is the bedrock for setting up an observability framework. The application code is instrumented using OpenTelemetry client libraries, which enables the generation of telemetry data. Once the telemetry data is generated and collected, you need to configure the OpenTelemetry exporter to send data to a backed analysis tool like [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/).

## Instrumenting a sample Java app for traces

In this section, you will learn to instrument a Java application with OpenTelemetry to get traces.

### Prerequisite

- A [SigNoz Cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/) account
- Java 8 or newer (full JDK, not a JRE)
- <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry Jar agent</a>, latest version.

You need a backend to which you can send the collected data for monitoring and visualization. [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is an OpenTelemetry-native APM that is well-suited for visualizing OpenTelemetry data.

SigNoz cloud is the easiest way to run SigNoz. You can sign up [here](https://signoz.io/teams/) for a free account and get 30 days of unlimited access to all features.

You can also install and self-host SigNoz yourself. Check out the [docs](https://signoz.io/docs/install/) for installing self-host SigNoz.

### Install the OpenTelemetry Jar agent

To instrument your Java application, the OpenTelemetry Java Jar agent will be utilized. The JAR agent can be attached to any Java 8+ application. It can detect a number of <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/docs/supported-libraries.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">popular libraries and frameworks</a> and instrument them right out of the box. You don't need to add any code for that.

To download the Java Jar agent, run the below command in your terminal:

```
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
```

<Admonition>
The path to where the Jar file was downloaded will be used later, so note it down somewhere.
</Admonition>

### Set up the Java application

A sample Java application has been provided. Run the below commands to set it up:

```jsx
# Clone the Spring PetClinic repository from SigNoz's GitHub
git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/spring-petclinic

# Change into the cloned directory
cd spring-petclinic

# Use Maven Wrapper to package the Spring PetClinic application
./mvnw package

# Run the Spring PetClinic application using the generated JAR file
`java -jar target/*.jar`
```

You can access the running app at [localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)

### Setting up auto-instrumentation for Java application

To auto-instrument the application, the Jar agent for instrumentation needs to be enabled. This helps in generating traces from the application, and the generated traces need to be sent to a backend for visualization. Here, the SigNoz cloud will serve as the backend for visualization.

To enable auto instrumentation, run the below command:

```bash
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443" OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=signoz-ingestion-key={your-ingestion-key} OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=java-app java -javaagent:/path/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar -jar target/*.jar
```

<Admonition>
- Replace `/path/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar` with the path from which the OpenTelemetry Java Jar agent was downloaded.
- Replace `{region}` with the region you selected when creating your SigNoz Cloud account.
- Replace `{your-ingestion-key}` with the ingestion key sent to your email address after the creation of your SigNoz Cloud account.

```
| Region | Endpoint                   |
| ------ | -------------------------- |
| US     | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN     | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU     | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |
```
</Admonition>

You can also find the ingestion details in SigNoz dashboard under the `Settings` tab.

    <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>

The application will be started again on the same address, localhost:8090, but this time, it will be able to send telemetry data to your SigNoz cloud account.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2023/11/java_app_running.webp" alt=""/>
    <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>

To see the application running in SigNoz, load the URL provided in the email sent to you during your SigNoz cloud account creation.

    <figcaption><i>java-app application being monitored in SigNoz</i></figcaption>
</figure>


From the left side bar, click on the “Traces” tab to see traces from the application. Click on the “Try new Traces Explorer” button to use the new Traces Explorer.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2023/11/new_trace_explorer_button.webp" alt="Old Traces Explorer Page"/>
    <figcaption><i>Old Traces Explorer Page</i></figcaption>
</figure>


With this, you can run queries against your traces using the query builder.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2023/11/new_trace_explorer.webp" alt="New Traces Explorer Page"/>
    <figcaption><i>New Traces Explorer Page</i></figcaption>
</figure>


In the ‘Search Filter” input box, set your filter to ‘httpMethod=GET’ with the duration at 1hr and run the query. This will return every GET request that was generated within the last 1hr.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2023/11/query_builder_screen.webp" alt="Query being run using the query builder"/>
    <figcaption><i>Query being run using the query builder</i></figcaption>
</figure>


From the above image, no GET request was returned. This is because the Java application hasn’t been accessed at [localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090) yet. To generate an HTTP GET request, visit the application at [localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090) and try to refresh it one or two times. After that, on your SigNoz dashboard, still on the Traces Explorer page, change the duration to the ‘Last 5 min’, give it some time, and then run the same query again. You should see the GET requests you generated.

    <img src="/img/blog/2023/11/traces_GET_request.webp" alt="GET requests returned from query"/>
    <figcaption><i>GET requests returned from query</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Click on the ‘Trace ID’ of any of the traces. From the below image, at the top, you can see the ‘Trace Details’ of that particular trace, showing that it has three spans, which were the GET requests.

    <figcaption><i>Flamegraph for a trace in SigNoz dashboard</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Click on the ‘drop-down’ arrow to see each span and the duration.

    <figcaption><i>Drop down arrow to see the spans</i></figcaption>
</figure>


To get more information from a span, you can click on it. This provides you with the name of the Service that the span came from, the operation, and resource attributes.
