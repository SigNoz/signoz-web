We’re excited to announce that SigNoz Cloud Teams plan now starts at [**\$49/month (earlier at \$199/month)**](https://signoz.io/pricing/), making world-class observability accessible to every team building in the age of AI. Usage-based pricing for each signal(logs, metrics and traces) remains the same as before. $49 base fee includes usage up to that amount, just like before.

And there’s no feature-gating (all features can be accessed with our base plan). Our vision is to democratize access to robust observability for engineering teams of all sizes - that's why we’re open-source too. We also **do not charge based on user seats or the number of hosts** that you want to monitor. So you can add unlimited team members and monitor any number of hosts with our base plan.

## What does this change mean for existing users?

If your monthly usage is **more than \$199**, then **no change**. You’ll continue to pay based on your actual usage.

If your monthly usage is **less than \$199**, you now pay **only your usage**, with a minimum of \$49. *Example: If your usage is \$120, your total bill will be \$120 (not \$199).*

Your next invoice will automatically reflect the reduced base fee.

## Why this change and why now?

We have always believed in keeping pricing transparent and straightforward. At \$0.3 per GB of ingested logs/traces and \$0.1 per million samples for metrics, we offer one of the best value for money observability platform.

But why are we reducing our base fee, and why now?

In the past few months, we have seen a surge in new-age companies that have embraced AI fully, signing up for our cloud plans. Observability is more critical for them, as AI coding assistants become the default way of building new products.

## AI coding assistants are now the default

LLMs are fundamentally nondeterministic. The same input can produce different outputs, which means automated testing often fails to catch unpredictable behaviours and subtle bugs. For developers using AI coding assistants, this unpredictability is not theoretical. AI-generated code can silently introduce errors, security gaps, or logic that breaks builds in production. As teams move faster with AI, the risks of undetected issues multiply, and the need for granular, real-time observability becomes non-negotiable.

## More startups now need robust observability

Observability can’t be an afterthought in the era of AI-led development. Today, startups are leading the global AI adoption wave. Recent data from [Y Combinator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TECDj4JUx7o) shows that in their latest batch, **33–50% of startups primarily use AI coding tools to write their code,** a dramatic rise from just 25% in the prior batch and nearly 0% two batches ago. This surge highlights how quickly LLM-powered coding is becoming the norm among the world’s most ambitious startups.

But with this rapid adoption comes real risk. LLM-powered systems are prone to issues like model drift, hallucinated outputs, prompt injection vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and unpredictable behaviour. These problems have been making headlines in 2025. 

Many of these challenges only become apparent in production, where real-world data and user interactions expose failures that automated tests can’t catch. Silent failures, such as gradual drops in accuracy or unexpected output formats, can go unnoticed until they impact users or business outcomes. This is why robust observability is essential for engineering teams working with AI-generated code. 

Despite this urgent need, most observability tools are expensive and complex. Legacy platforms like DataDog rely on unpredictable, SKU-based pricing and charge extra for features like custom metrics, making them difficult for early-stage teams to adopt.

## We’re here to help

We’ve always been committed to democratizing observability, starting with our open-source platform. With our new $49/month SigNoz Cloud plan, we’re extending that same ethos to our cloud offering, removing cost barriers and giving every builder, founder, and developer the tools they need to ship reliable, scalable AI products from day one.

If you’re building with LLMs and AI coding assistants, observability is the foundation for reliability, trust, and speed.

Here’s our [monthly cost estimator](https://signoz.io/pricing/#estimate-your-monthly-bill) to help you estimate your bill. You can also apply to our [startup program](https://signoz.io/startups/), which starts at just $19/month.
