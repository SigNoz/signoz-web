We sat down with Ankit, CTO and co-founder at SigNoz to get his insights on the product’s developments and what's on the horizon. He shared valuable perspectives on how SigNoz is enhancing the user experience, focusing on customer feedback, and building new features. 

Here’s the full video of the conversation:

Here's the gist of the conversation.

## A User-Focused Approach to Observability

Ankit highlighted that the core focus over the past few months has been on improving the overall user experience by eliminating friction points and simplifying complex workflows. He emphasized the importance of building a product that caters to all teams, from small startups to large enterprises. This has involved working closely with customers and the open-source community to identify and address various pain points in creating dashboards, configuring alerts, and using other core functionalities.

Here are the main areas of focus from the latest releases:

### 1. Ingestion Key Control

Users requested more control over the data being sent to SigNoz. That’s why we launched [Ingest Guard](https://signoz.io/blog/introducing-ingest-guard-feature/). It provides security-conscious teams with the ability to manage ingestion keys effectively and control which data gets monitored. Customers can now prevent sudden data spikes due to unexpected incidents in development or production environments and also control observability costs.

### 2. Enhanced Insights and Intelligent Alerts

This launch week marks the beginning of building more intelligent insights into SigNoz. The team has focused on correlating signals and generating insights that help users understand their system's health at a deeper level. Notable features in this area include:

- Alert History with Top Contributors: Users can now get a comprehensive view of what triggers alerts and identify the top contributors to specific issues.
- Anomaly Detection: Ankit mentioned the importance of [anomaly detection](https://signoz.io/blog/introducing-anomaly-detection-for-smarter-alerts/), especially for companies that do not want to set fixed alert thresholds. The system intelligently identifies patterns, such as daily spikes, to ensure that users are not overwhelmed by unnecessary alerts.

### 3. Correlating Across Signals

SigNoz aims to provide seamless navigation across various telemetry signals—metrics, traces, and logs. The newly introduced correlation features let users:

- Jump from APM metrics to traces and logs.
- View infra metrics alongside logs for a holistic debugging experience.

This capability enables users to resolve issues faster by giving them the complete context of any error or performance issue in their application.

## Key Learnings from Customers and Community

We’re thankful to the open-source community for playing a significant role in shaping SigNoz's direction. He discussed some key insights gained from engaging with customers:

- AI and LLM Applications: It’s great to see many AI and LLM companies using SigNoz to monitor their models and apps. This has been an eye-opener, revealing that SigNoz is flexible and robust enough to handle new and evolving use cases. SigNoz's user-based pricing and self-hosting flexibility make it a suitable choice for these companies.
- Ingestion Control and FinOps: As larger enterprises adopt SigNoz, their need for ingestion key rotation and data control has become apparent. This feedback has directly influenced product development, leading to the creation of ingest guard features to help teams monitor usage more effectively.

## What’s Next for SigNoz?

Here’s a sneak peek into SigNoz’s roadmap for the next few months:

### 1. Infrastructure Monitoring Module

SigNoz plans to introduce a dedicated infrastructure monitoring module, allowing users to monitor clusters, nodes, namespaces, and workloads. This will give users a deeper understanding of their infrastructure and help them debug issues by correlating with other signals in the product.

### 2. Deeper Correlation and Unified Observability

The team aims to enhance signal correlations, making it easier to move between metrics, logs, traces, and infrastructure metrics. This unification will enable a seamless debugging experience and offer richer insights into system behavior.

### 3. OpenTelemetry Native Features

We’re committed to being OpenTelemetry-native. The goal is to leverage OpenTelemetry’s semantic conventions to build out-of-the-box insights and provide more powerful debugging tools. This includes better use of OpenTelemetry resource attributes for filtering logs and identifying anomalies.

## Looking forward to more community feedback

We’re grateful to our open-source community - the love and the feedback keep pouring in. We look forward to our users sharing their feedback through [Slack](https://signoz.io/slack/) or [Github](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz) to help build the future of observability.
