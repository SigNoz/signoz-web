Are you looking for Grafana alternatives? Then you have come to the right place. Grafana started as a data visualization tool. It slowly evolved into a tool that can take data from multiple data sources for visualization. For observability, Grafana offers the LGTM stack (Loki for logs, Grafana for visualization, Tempo for traces, and Mimir for metrics). You need to configure and maintain multiple configurations for a full-stack observability setup.

While Grafana offers great visualization capabilities, it lacks advanced analytics features that organizations with complex data monitoring needs may require. For example, Loki is the product by Grafana for log management. It is designed to keep indexing low.

It does not support high cardinality. For example, if you create a label for the user's IP address, you will have thousands of log streams, as every user will have a unique IP. This can make Loki very slow as it requires building a huge index.

In this article, we will discuss the top 11 Grafana alternatives that you can choose from if you’re looking for a Grafana replacement.

## Top 11 Grafana Alternatives

1. SigNoz (Open-Source)
2. Kibana
3. Datadog
4. New Relic
5. Splunk
6. Prometheus
7. Dynatrace
8. AppDynamics
9. VictoriaMetrics
10. Metabase
11. Zabbix
