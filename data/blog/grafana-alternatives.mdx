While Grafana began as a powerful data visualization tool, its evolution into a multi-tool observability platform — with Loki for logs, Tempo for traces, and Mimir for metrics—often means managing several moving parts. 

**Key challenges with Grafana include:**

- **Multiple Backends to Manage**: For full-stack observability, Grafana relies on a suite of tools—Loki for logs, Tempo for traces, and Mimir for metrics. This composable setup means you must configure and maintain separate systems, which increases operational overhead.
- **Handling High-Cardinality Data**: Loki, designed for cost-effective log aggregation, intentionally keeps indexing low. However, when dealing with high-cardinality fields (like unique user IP addresses), it can result in thousands of log streams that slow down query performance.
- **Fragmented Observability Experience**: The need to integrate and correlate data from different backends often leads to a steeper learning curve and can make troubleshooting more time-consuming.

If these challenges sound familiar, you’re not alone. In this article, we explore the top 11 Grafana alternatives that aim to streamline observability and provide a more integrated, efficient experience.

## SigNoz

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/product-comparison/signoz-vs-grafana/) can be a great Grafana alternative. SigNoz is also open-source, just like Grafana. So, if you want to self-host SigNoz, clone the <a href = "https://github.com/signoz/signoz/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >GitHub repo</a> to get started.

### Architecture & Data Storage

Under the hood, Grafana is powered by multiple tools like Loki, Tempo, Mimir & Prometheus. In contrast, SigNoz is built as a unified tool serving logs, metrics, and traces in a single pane of glass.

SigNoz uses a single datastore - ClickHouse to power its observability stack. This makes SigNoz much better in correlating signals and driving better insights.

### OpenTelemetry Support

SigNoz is built to support OpenTelemetry. <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry</a> is an open-source standard for generating telemetry signals, which allows you to:
- Avoid vendor lock-in 
- Have flexibility in choosing different backends for different signals

SigNoz indexes all OpenTelemetry (OTel) attributes—whether string, number, or boolean—without the limitations imposed by tools like Loki. This means you can effortlessly query and aggregate high-cardinality data (such as detailed duration metrics) without performance penalties.

### Key Features

#### Application Performance Monitoring
SigNoz comes with out-of-the-box APM charts like p90, p99 latency, request rates, and error rates. You can also monitor database calls and external calls as soon as you instrument your application with OpenTelemetry SDKs.

### Performance & Pricing

We did a [logs performance benchmark of open-source SigNoz with Elasticsearch and Loki](/blog/logs-performance-benchmark). Our key findings for Loki showed:
- Ingestion is mainly limited by the number of streams that it can handle
- Loki was not able to return the results of our test queries
- Loki took the least amount of storage as it indexed only two keys

We also did a [pricing comparison of SigNoz with other popularity observability tools](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/) including Grafana. SigNoz can save up to 45% of your Grafana bill.
