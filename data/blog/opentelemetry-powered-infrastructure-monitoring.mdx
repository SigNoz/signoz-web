Today, we’re excited to announce a much-awaited feature in SigNoz: Infrastructure Monitoring, built natively on OpenTelemetry.

Infrastructure monitoring is a critical aspect of modern observability. Without proper visibility into your infrastructure resources, troubleshooting issues, optimizing costs, and maintaining performance become challenging. 

With our latest OpenTelemetry-powered Infra Monitoring, we bring you a native OpenTelemetry experience that seamlessly integrates infrastructure metrics with application performance data.

## Why Infrastructure Monitoring Matters

Every application relies on an underlying infrastructure—whether it's cloud-based instances, Kubernetes clusters, or on-premise machines. Without clear visibility into how resources are being utilized, teams face multiple challenges:

- Unnecessary resource consumption: Over-provisioning leads to wasted compute and storage costs, while under-provisioning impacts performance.
- Troubleshooting inefficiencies: Diagnosing high latency or service disruptions without visibility into infrastructure metrics is like flying blind.
- Lack of correlation: Understanding whether application issues or infrastructure bottlenecks cause performance degradation requires deeper insights.
- Limited automation: Teams often react to issues after customers report them without proactive alerting.

SigNoz Infra Monitoring is designed to solve these problems with a true OpenTelemetry-native experience, ensuring seamless data collection, better correlation, and reduced operational overhead.

## What Makes SigNoz Infra Monitoring Unique?

Unlike legacy monitoring solutions that patch OpenTelemetry support onto their existing proprietary architectures, SigNoz is built ground-up for OpenTelemetry. Here’s what sets it apart:

### No proprietary agents

Other platforms rely on proprietary agents for infrastructure metrics, creating friction when integrating OpenTelemetry data. SigNoz natively supports OpenTelemetry without extra transformation layers.

Many monitoring vendors attempt to integrate OpenTelemetry into their existing platforms as an afterthought rather than designing their systems around it. This leads to data transformation complexities, where users must map OpenTelemetry data to proprietary formats, causing inconsistencies and friction.

Moreover, since these platforms rely on custom agents, the correlation between infrastructure metrics, traces, and logs often breaks down, making debugging far more difficult.

### Seamless correlation

By adhering to OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions, SigNoz ensures that logs, traces, and infra metrics are correlated without complex data mapping.

## Bringing Application & Infrastructure Together with OpenTelemetry Correlation

One of the biggest challenges in modern observability is correlating application performance with infrastructure health. SigNoz leverages OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions to ensure seamless correlation.

These conventions define a common schema for naming and structuring telemetry data, ensuring that logs, metrics, and traces from various sources can be meaningfully correlated without custom transformations.

For example:

- The attribute `host.name` is consistently used to identify a host across different telemetry signals—whether it's system metrics, traces, or logs.
- Kubernetes-specific attributes like `k8s.node.name` and `k8s.pod.name` allow users to easily filter and correlate telemetry data across their containerized environments.
- Standardized resource attributes ensure that CPU, memory, and network metrics are uniformly structured, simplifying analytics and troubleshooting

By strictly adhering to OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions, SigNoz ensures that infrastructure monitoring is consistent, predictable, and interoperable with other OpenTelemetry-based tools.

This correlation eliminates guesswork and significantly reduces Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) when debugging performance issues.
