### What is Splunk?

Splunk is a log analysis platform that collects, indexes, and analyzes data from various sources, including messaging systems, databases, network devices, and more. It doesn't matter where your data is coming from; Splunk can normalize and extract fields from it automatically, which makes it a great tool for troubleshooting and identifying patterns in data.

Three key components in Splunk are its **forwarder**, **indexer**, and **search head**.

The forwarder pushes data to a remote indexer. The indexer manages all the indexing and search queries. The search head is the front-end web interface where these 3 components can be combined.

With Splunk, you can search and analyze large amounts of data in real-time, and it provides pre-built visualizations to help you quickly create informative dashboards.


## Grafana vs Splunk: Key Differences

### Data Collection & Integration

While Splunk and Grafana are both data collection and analysis tools, they have different features and approaches in regard to data collection & ingestion.

**Splunk is a centralized log management tool** that can collect and store large amounts of data from various sources. This data is stored in an index, where it can be analyzed using Splunk's powerful search language.

As per the <a href = "https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/DSP/1.3.1/Connection/AboutDataCollection" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" > official documents </a> of Splunk, data collection depends on what type of data source a client is using. These are the methods that Splunk uses for data collection.

- Ingest service which collects JSON objects from `/events` and `/metrics` endpoint of the ingest REST API.
- Forwarder service, which collects data from the Splunk forwarder.
- DSP HTTP event collector which collects data from HTTP clients and Syslog data sources.
- DSP Collect connectors that collect data from several types of data sources such as Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, Azure, etc. These collectors collect data through jobs that run on a schedule.
- Steaming connectors collect data from several data sources such as Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, etc. These types of connectors receive data continuously emitted by the sources.


Splunk also has over 600 apps providing reports, dashboards, and data knowledge available at Splunkbase.

**Grafana**, meanwhile, **is an open-source platform for data visualization and monitoring**. It focuses on providing graphical representations of metrics. It can connect to various data sources, including InfluxDB, Prometheus, Elasticsearch, etc., and retrieve data using SQL-like query language.

Unlike Splunk, Grafana is open-source, thus making integration with any data source possible both through the community-published plugins and by creating your own plugins.

### Data Querying

In the previous step you’ve learned how the two tools integrate data, now its time to query and that data (and visualize).

**Splunk**

Splunk has dozen of ways for data querying. The simplest solutions is to use <a href = "https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.2.0/SearchTutorial/Startsearching" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Splunk Search</a> - a simple method for data query from the dashboard.

<a href = "https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SOAR/current/PlatformAPI/Using" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Splunk SOAR (Cloud)</a> is a REST API for data query that allows deep query customization from the backend.

Splunk also uses its custom Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) which is optimized for searching, analyzing, and visualizing large volumes of machine-generated data. SPL offers a rich set of commands for data manipulation, extraction, and analysis.

### Data Visualisation & UI/UX

Both Grafana and Splunk offer a great set of visualization capabilities.

**Splunk**

In our research, Splunk's UI/UX experience has been excellent. Some parts of the UI, documentation and overall product do lack clarity and can be hard to navigate and read. But, Splunk's customizability is where it shines. Splunk provides a dashboard studio that lets you customize dashboards in Splunk with control over dashboard’s layout, images, colors, and more.

You can literally make anything in Splunk, change every single bit on a given dashboard to customize it to your customers' needs.

    <figcaption><i>Splunk Log Observer (Source: Splunk website</i></figcaption>
</figure>


**Grafana**

As a multi-year Grafana user, I have really adopted the interface since my early adoption I've managed to work easily without many hiccups.

Grafana's UI is very simple, without many elements (though you can add many, many elements in the dashboard) that interfere with the mental/visual overload. The UI elements have enough clarity and intuitiveness.

In Grafana, you need to set up these dashboards and panels, which requires some bandwidth depending on which metrics you wish to visualize. You can build a powerful dashboard by selecting a data source and then combining panels associated with different data sources together.

    <figcaption><i>Grafana dashboard visualization capabilities (Source: Grafana website</i></figcaption>
</figure>



### Alerting and Notifications:

Splunk provides robust alerting capabilities, so alerts can be triggered based on conditions and thresholds. Alerts are sent through different channels, such as Slack, PagerDuty, ServiceNow, SMS, and email — and the built-in alert manager allows users to manage & track multiple sources of alerts in one place.

Grafana has a built-in alert manager for real-time monitoring and alerts. Alerts can be configured based on conditions and thresholds and can be sent through various notification channels such as email, Slack, etc. Grafana enables users to create alerting rules at a dashboard panel level, making it easy to set up and manage alerts for specific data sets.

Both Splunk and Grafana provide robust capabilities, but Splunk provides more advanced alert management and tracking, while Grafana provides more granular control over alerting rules at the panel level.

### Pricing

**Splunk**

As an enterprise-oriented product, you need to schedule a sales meeting with a Splunk Pricing Expert to get an estimate. Scheduling a long sales meeting isn't very convenient, as such products tend to require a minimum amount of seats and bill annually, so depending on your use case Splunk may not be the best option.

What we do know without a sales meeting is how Splunk tiers its pricing:

- Workload Pricing: This pricing plan makes it very economical to bring more data into Splunk that is less frequently searched.

- Ingest Pricing: Pay based on the amount of data you bring into the Splunk Cloud Platform.

- Entity Pricing: Controllable plan that is based on the number of hosts using Splunk observability products.

- Activity-based pricing: Connect costs directly to activities being monitored by Splunk observability products like metric time series (MTS), traces analyzed per minute, sessions, or uptime requests.

**Grafana**

Grafana, on the other hand, has simpler pricing. It has a simpler model than Splunk's pricing model. Grafana has a decent "free forever" plan with the following key specs:

- all Grafana Cloud features
- 10k metrics billable series, 14 days retention
- 3 active users with Enterprise plugins

Like Splunk, Grafana also offers a (similar) pay-as-you-go plan starting free, then you just pay for the used resources. That's the simple part of Grafana's pricing, they also have detailed <a href = "https://grafana.com/pricing/#metrics" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >usage-based pricing</a>.
