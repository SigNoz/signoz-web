Node.js is one of the most popular frameworks for server-side programming. As it's based on JavaScript, it's easy to learn and widely used by both enterprises and startups. However, Node.js applications can be prone to issues like memory leaks and high CPU loads due to its dynamically typed, single-threaded nature.

This makes performance monitoring crucial for Node.js applications. But monitoring just the web servers isn't enough - you need visibility into your entire application stack for robust performance management.

In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to implement full-stack monitoring for a MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node) application using OpenTelemetry and SigNoz. We'll cover:

- Instrumenting the sample Node.js app components
- Monitoring Node.js performance with SigNoz dashboards

Let's get started by learning about OpenTelemetry and SigNoz, the key tools we'll use for end-to-end application monitoring.

## What is Node.js Performance Monitoring?

Node.js performance monitoring is the practice of tracking, measuring, and analyzing various aspects of a Node.js application's behavior and resource usage. It involves collecting data on key performance indicators (KPIs) to ensure optimal application health and user experience.

Key components of Node.js performance monitoring include:

1. **Resource usage**: CPU, memory, and disk utilization
2. **Response times**: How quickly your application responds to requests
3. **Error rates**: The frequency and types of errors occurring in your application
4. **Throughput**: The number of requests your application can handle

<Figure src="/img/blog/2024/09/NodeJS-performance-monitoring-image%201.webp" alt="" caption="Key Metrics for NodeJS Performance Monitoring" />Performance monitoring differs from application logging in its focus and purpose. While logging captures specific events or errors for debugging, performance monitoring provides a broader view of your application's health and efficiency.

In the DevOps landscape, Node.js performance monitoring is a critical part of observability — the ability to understand your system's internal state based on its external outputs.

## Why is Node.js Performance Monitoring Critical?

Imagine you're running an e-commerce site during a major sale. Suddenly, response times spike, and customers start complaining about slow page loads. Without proper monitoring, you're flying blind — unable to identify or resolve the issue quickly.

Node.js applications face unique challenges:

1. **Event loop blocking**: Long-running operations can stall the entire application
2. **Memory leaks**: Improper memory management can lead to crashes and poor performance
3. **Scaling issues**: Node.js's single-threaded nature requires careful monitoring as traffic increases

Proactive monitoring helps you catch these issues before they impact users. For example, monitoring helped one company identify a memory leak causing periodic crashes, saving them potential revenue loss and reputational damage.

## Essential Metrics for Node.js Performance Monitoring

To effectively monitor your Node.js application, focus on these key metrics:

1. **CPU Usage**: High CPU usage can indicate inefficient code or the need for scaling.
2. **Memory Consumption**: Track memory usage patterns to identify potential leaks.
3. **Event Loop Lag**: Measures how long operations wait in the event queue — a key indicator of application responsiveness.
4. **Network I/O**: Monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic to identify bottlenecks.
5. **Database Query Performance**: Slow queries can significantly impact overall application performance.

### Advanced Metrics to Consider

As you deepen your monitoring practices, consider these advanced metrics:

1. **Garbage Collection**: Frequent or long-running garbage collection can impact performance.
2. **Clustering Efficiency**: In multi-core environments, ensure your clusters are utilized effectively.
3. **External Service Dependencies**: Monitor the performance of APIs or services your application relies on.
4. **Custom Application Metrics**: Track business-specific KPIs relevant to your application's goals.

## How to Implement Node.js Performance Monitoring

Implementing performance monitoring in your Node.js application involves several steps:

1. **Use Built-in Tools**: Node.js provides basic monitoring capabilities out of the box. For example, you can use `process.memoryUsage()` to track memory consumption:
    
    ```jsx
    console.log(process.memoryUsage());
    // Output: { rss: 4935680, heapTotal: 1826816, heapUsed: 650472, external: 49879 }
    
    ```
    
2. **Integrate Third-party Libraries**: Libraries like `prom-client` can help you collect and expose metrics:
    
    ```jsx
    const client = require('prom-client');
    const counter = new client.Counter({
      name: 'my_request_counter',
      help: 'Number of requests processed'
    });
    
    // Increment the counter in your request handler
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      counter.inc();
      res.send('Hello World!');
    });
    
    ```
    
3. **Implement Custom Metrics**: Track business-specific KPIs that matter to your application:
    
    ```jsx
    const userSignups = new client.Counter({
      name: 'user_signups_total',
      help: 'Total number of user signups'
    });
    
    // Increment in your signup route
    app.post('/signup', (req, res) => {
      // ... signup logic
      userSignups.inc();
    });
    
    ```
    
4. **Best Practices**:
    - Instrument code carefully to avoid impacting performance
    - Use sampling for high-volume metrics
    - Aggregate data where possible to reduce storage and processing overhead

## Using OpenTelemetry and SigNoz for NodeJS Performance Monitoring

<a href="https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry</a> is a vendor-agnostic set of tools, APIs, and SDKs used to instrument applications to create and manage telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces). It aims to make telemetry data a built-in feature of cloud-native software applications.

OpenTelemetry provides the instrumentation layer to generate and export your telemetry data to a backend. Then, you need to choose a backend tool that will provide the data storage and visualization for your telemetry data. That’s where SigNoz comes into the picture.

SigNoz is an open-source application performance monitoring (APM) tool that provides comprehensive monitoring for Node.js applications. It offers features like distributed tracing, metrics monitoring, and log management in a single platform.

<GetStartedSigNoz />

Key features of SigNoz for Node.js performance monitoring include:

1. **Auto-instrumentation**: Easily instrument your Node.js application with minimal code changes
2. **Custom dashboards**: Create tailored views of your application's performance
3. **Alerts**: Set up notifications for when metrics exceed defined thresholds
4. **Trace analysis**: Identify bottlenecks in your application with detailed transaction traces

Compared to other open-source alternatives, SigNoz supports OpenTelemetry natively and offers a more integrated solution, combining metrics, traces, and logs in one platform

## NodeJS Performance Monitoring with OpenTelemetry and SigNoz

To monitor the NodeJS application for performance issues, we need good telemetry data. Telemetry data can be anything that tells us how the application is performing while processing user requests. Once we have that telemetry data, it needs to be visualized for actionable insights.

OpenTelemetry helps you to generate telemetry data, as mentioned before. And SigNoz helps to store, visualize and run queries on the data. Together, OpenTelemetry and SigNoz make a great combo to monitor NodeJS applications for performance issues.

The first step is to instrument your application with OpenTelemetry client libraries. Instrumentation is the process of enabling your application code to generate telemetry data.

We will divide the tutorial into two parts:

- Instrumenting the sample NodeJS app
    - Instrumenting the frontend application made with Vuejs
    - Instrumenting node/express server
    - Instrumenting MongoDB database calls
- Monitor NodeJS performance with SigNoz dashboards

## Installing SigNoz

First of all, you need to install SigNoz. OpenTelemetry does not provide any storage capabilities, so you need to export the data to SigNoz backend once it is collected through OpenTelemetry.

SigNoz can be installed on macOS or Linux computers in just three steps by using a simple installation script.

The install script automatically installs Docker Engine on Linux. However, on macOS, you must manually install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker Engine</a> before running the install script.

```bash
git clone -b main <https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git>
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh

```

You can visit our documentation for instructions on how to install SigNoz using Docker Swarm and Helm Charts.

<Figure src="/img/blog/common/deploy_docker_documentation.webp" alt="" caption="" />

When you are done installing SigNoz, you can access the UI at <a href="http://localhost:3301/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://localhost:3301</a>

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
<img src="/img/blog/common/signoz_dashboard_homepage.webp" alt="SigNoz dashboard"/>
<figcaption><i>SigNoz dashboard - It shows services from a sample app that comes bundled with the application</i></figcaption>
</figure>

You can remove the sample applications from SigNoz by following the instructions [here](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/docker-standalone/#remove-the-sample-application).

## Instrumenting the full-stack application with OpenTelemetry

In this section, we will be monitoring the API calls made from the frontend Vuejs application through the express and NodeJS server and finally to Mongodb with OpenTelemetry.

You can find the application code instrumented with OpenTelemetry and ready to be monitored with SigNoz [here](https://github.com/SigNoz/mevn-opentelemetry-example). Get it to your local by cloning the GitHub repo:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/SigNoz/mevn-opentelemetry-example.git>

```

In the sample app repo, the SigNoz folder is also included. You can keep your SigNoz folder anywhere you want. The section below explains how to go about setting up the MEVN application for monitoring.

<Admonition>
The GitHub sample app is already instrumented with OpenTelemetry.

### Frontend monitoring set up

Get into `/client` application and install the OpenTelemetry dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm i @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-web @opentelemetry/resources @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base @opentelemetry/exporter-collector @opentelemetry/context-zone @opentelemetry/instrumentation-fetch @opentelemetry/instrumentation

```

Now create a file called `tracing.js` in the `/src` folder, and in that file, we will be adding the required setup to enable frontend tracing.

Paste the following code in `src/tracing.js` file:

```jsx
import { context, trace, SpanStatusCode } from "@opentelemetry/api";
import { WebTracerProvider } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-web";
import { Resource } from "@opentelemetry/resources";
import { SimpleSpanProcessor } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base";
import { CollectorTraceExporter } from "@opentelemetry/exporter-collector";
import { ZoneContextManager } from "@opentelemetry/context-zone";
import { FetchInstrumentation } from "@opentelemetry/instrumentation-fetch";
import { registerInstrumentations } from "@opentelemetry/instrumentation";

const serviceName = "link-frontend"; //remember this service name

const resource = new Resource({ "service.name": serviceName });
const provider = new WebTracerProvider({ resource });

const collector = new CollectorTraceExporter({
  url: "<http://localhost:4318/v1/traces>",
});

provider.addSpanProcessor(new SimpleSpanProcessor(collector));
provider.register({ contextManager: new ZoneContextManager() });

const webTracerWithZone = provider.getTracer(serviceName);

var bindingSpan;

window.startBindingSpan = (traceId, spanId, traceFlags) => {
  bindingSpan = webTracerWithZone.startSpan("");
  bindingSpan.spanContext().traceId = traceId;
  bindingSpan.spanContext().spanId = spanId;
  bindingSpan.spanContext().traceFlags = traceFlags;
};

registerInstrumentations({
  instrumentations: [
    new FetchInstrumentation({
      propagateTraceHeaderCorsUrls: ["/.*/g"],
      clearTimingResources: true,
      applyCustomAttributesOnSpan: (span, request, result) => {
        const attributes = span.attributes;
        if (attributes.component === "fetch") {
          span.updateName(
            `${attributes["http.method"]} ${attributes["http.url"]}`
          );
        }
        if (result instanceof Error) {
          span.setStatus({
            code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR,
            message: result.message,
          });
          span.recordException(result.stack || result.name);
        }
      },
    }),
  ],
});

// This is the function that we will be using to trace function calls
export function traceSpan(name, func) {
  var singleSpan;
  if (bindingSpan) {
    const ctx = trace.setSpan(context.active(), bindingSpan);
    singleSpan = webTracerWithZone.startSpan(name, undefined, ctx);
    bindingSpan = undefined;
  } else {
    singleSpan = webTracerWithZone.startSpan(name);
  }
  return context.with(trace.setSpan(context.active(), singleSpan), () => {
    try {
      const result = func();
      singleSpan.end();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      singleSpan.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR });
      singleSpan.end();
      throw error;
    }
  });
}

```

Now import the `traceSpan` function from the `src/tracing.js` file and use it with the functions that you're using to make API calls.

Inside the `<script>` section in `App.vue`

```jsx
import { traceSpan } from "./tracing";
.
.
.
methods: {
    async addTodo() {
      const response = await axios.post("api/todoList/", {
        title: this.title,
        description: this.description
      });
      this.todos.push(response.data);
      this.title = "";
      this.description = "";
    },
    async removeTodo(item, i) {
      await axios.delete("api/todoList/" + item._id);
      this.todos.splice(i, 1);
    },

	// these are the functions that we're going to use to add and remove todo
    async handleAddTodo(e){
	    e.preventDefault();
	    await traceSpan("addTodo", this.addTodo);
   },
    async handleRemoveTodo(todo, i){
      await traceSpan("removeTodo", this.removeTodo(todo, i));
    }
  }

```

Inside the `<template>` section in `App.vue`, remove `addTodo()` & `removeTodo` and use `handleAddTodo()` & `handleRemoveTodo()`:

```html
<template>
 <div class="main">
  <h3>Todo List</h3>

  <form class="form" >
    <input class="input" v-model="title" type="text" name="name" placeholder="Enter Todo" />
    <br />
    <input class="input" v-model="description" type="text" name="description"  placeholder="Enter Description" />
    <br />
    <button class="submit-button" @click="handleAddTodo"> Add Todo</button>
  </form>
  <div class="todo-container">
    <ul>
      <li v-for="(todo, i) in todos" :key="todo._id">
        <div class="todo">
        <span class="todo-name">{{ todo.title }}</span>
        <span class="todo-description">{{ todo.description }}</span>
      </div>
        <button class="delete-btn" @click="handleRemoveTodo(todo, i)">DELETE TODO</button>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  </div>
</template>

```

Now, enable CORS in the OpenTelemetry Receiver.Under SigNoz folder, open the `otel-collector-config.yaml` file. The file is located at `deploy/docker/otel-collector-config.yaml`

You can view the file at [SigNoz GitHub repo](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/main/deploy/docker/otel-collector-config.yaml). Inside the file add the following CORS config:

```jsx
http:
  cors:
    allowed_origins:
      - <https://netflix.com>  # URL of your Frontend application

```

Update the URL in the config file to match your frontend application URL. For this tutorial, we will be running our frontend application on `http://localhost:8080`.

```jsx
http:
  cors:
    allowed_origins:
      - <http://localhost:8080>

```

{/* Here’s a snapshot from the GitHub repo. You can find the file [here](https://github.com/SigNoz/mevn-opentelemetry-example/blob/main/signoz/deploy/docker/otel-collector-config.yaml).

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
<img src="/img/blog/2022/06/enable_cors.webp" alt="Enabling CORS"/>
<figcaption><i>Enabling CORS</i></figcaption>
</figure> */}

After adding the changes, you need to restart the SigNoz Docker containers.

**To stop the running SigNoz cluster:**

```
cd deploy/docker
sudo docker compose stop
```

**To start/resume the running SigNoz cluster:**

```
cd deploy/docker
sudo docker compose start
```

<Admonition>
The stopped SigNoz cluster should resume and mount to the existing docker volumes.
</Admonition>

And congratulations, your frontend application made with Vuejs is now instrumented with OpenTelemetry.

### Backend monitoring setup

Now, get into `/server` and follow the below steps

**Step1:** **Install** **OpenTelemetry** **packages**:

```jsx
npm install --save @opentelemetry/sdk-node
npm install --save @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
npm install --save @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http

```

**Step 2: Create `tracing.js` file**

Instantiate tracing by creating a `tracing.js` file and using the below code:

```jsx
// tracing.js
"use strict";
const process = require("process");
const opentelemetry = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-node");
const {
  getNodeAutoInstrumentations,
} = require("@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node");
const {
  OTLPTraceExporter,
} = require("@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http");

// configure the SDK to export telemetry data to the console
// enable all auto-instrumentations from the meta package
const traceExporter = new OTLPTraceExporter();
const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  traceExporter,
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
});

// initialize the SDK and register with the OpenTelemetry API
// this enables the API to record telemetry
sdk
  .start()
  .then(() => console.log("Tracing initialized"))
  .catch((error) => console.log("Error initializing tracing", error));

// gracefully shut down the SDK on process exit
process.on("SIGTERM", () => {
  sdk
    .shutdown()
    .then(() => console.log("Tracing terminated"))
    .catch((error) => console.log("Error terminating tracing", error))
    .finally(() => process.exit(0));
});

```

**Pass the necessary environment variable**

Once the file is created, you only need to run one last command at your terminal, which passes the necessary environment variables. Here, you also set SigNoz as your backend analysis tool.

```jsx
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="<IP of SigNoz>:4318"
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name> \\

```

Replacing the placeholders in the above command for localhost:

`IP of SigNoz Backend`: localhost (since we are running SigNoz on our localhost).

`service_name`: mevn-signoz (you can give whatever name that suits you)

So the final command is:

```jsx
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="<http://localhost:4318>"
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=mevn-signoz

```

Change the `scripts` of `package.json` on `server` to initiate tracing of the API calls:

```jsx
//server/package.json
"scripts": {
    "start:server": "node -r ./tracing.js index.js",
    "start:client": "npm run serve --prefix '../client/'",
    "dev": "concurrently \\"npm run start:server\\" \\"npm run start:client\\""
  },

```

Now run both client & server:

```jsx
npm run dev

```

Now, the `client` should be running on <a href="http://localhost:8080/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">`http://localhost:8080`</a> while the `server`
runs on `http://localhost:3000`

Interact with the application a bit to generate some dummy data, and wait for the application to be visible on the SigNoz dashboard.

Below we can find the `mevn-signoz` in the list of applications being monitored.
