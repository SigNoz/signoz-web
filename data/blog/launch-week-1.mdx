Welcome to SigNoz Launch Week 1.0!

This is our first launch week, and weâ€™re excited to introduce you to some cool new features in SigNoz. We ship fast but often miss sharing the story behind these features with our community.

Launch week for us is an opportunity to share the behind-the-scenes of new features that we have built in the recent past. Our open-source maintainers will share the story on the whats, whys, and hows of new upgrades to SigNoz!


![Cover Image](/img/events/launch-week-1/signoz-launch-week-cover.webp)

The idea is very simple - we will announce one feature every day of the week.

## What to expect?

Features that will take observability experience in SigNoz to the next level! ðŸš€ðŸš€

And, of course, where there is SigNoz, there is OpenTelemetry. We will share lots of insights, best practices, and tidbits about OpenTelemetry.
