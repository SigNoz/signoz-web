## Overview


[ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that exposes metrics at several endpoints. This document will help you monitor your ArgoCD [metrics](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/metrics/) using SigNoz.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

- A running ArgoCD installation on your Kubernetes cluster

## Setup

### Step 1. Configure OpenTelemetry Collector

To collect ArgoCD metrics and send them to SigNoz, you need to configure the OpenTelemetry Collector with a Prometheus receiver. Follow this [document](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) to setup your OTel collector.

#### Add Prometheus Receiver

Ensure that the `prometheus` receiver is added to the collector`config.yaml` file. Make sure to set the targets as shown in the [config] code block (https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/argocd/readme.md#configure-opentelemetry-collector) below.

```yaml
prometheus:
  config:
    global:
      scrape_interval: 60s
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: argocd-metrics # A logical label used to group the set of targets being scraped; helps in querying and identifying metrics from this specific service (ArgoCD in this case)
        metrics_path: /metrics
        scheme: http
        static_configs:
          - targets:
            - localhost:8082  # Application metrics
            - localhost:8083  # API Server metrics
            - localhost:8084  # Repository Server metrics
```
Checkout this [link](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/argocd/readme.md#configure-opentelemetry-collector) to see the complete configuration file.

 Replace `localhost` with appropriate hostnames or service names if your ArgoCD is running in a different namespace or cluster.

### Step 2. Import ArgoCD Dashboard 

Once your ArgoCD metrics are flowing into SigNoz, you can utilize the pre-built ArgoCD dashboard to monitor your deployment.

1. Download the ArgoCD dashboard JSON from [SigNoz Dashboards Repository](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/argocd/argocd.json)

2. Import the dashboard in SigNoz:
   - Navigate to Dashboards in your SigNoz UI
   - Click on "Import Dashboard" in the top-right corner
   - Upload the downloaded JSON file
   - Click "Import"

For more information on managing dashboards, refer this [document](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/).

## Dashboard Features

The ArgoCD Dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into your ArgoCD deployment.

### Dashboard Variables

The dashboard includes variables that you can use to filter your data:

- `{{namespace}}`: Namespace of the application
- `{{health.status}}`: Health status of the application
- `{{repo}}`: Name of the repository

### Dashboard Metrics 

The dashboard displays key metrics to give you a complete view of your deployment status. It has the following sections:

1. **Overall Status** - Monitor the number of applications and repository server status
2. **Application Health** - Track healthy, processing, suspended, and degraded applications
3. **Synchronization Status** - Monitor synced and out-of-sync applications
4. **Controller Performance** - Track sync activity, reconciliation metrics, and Kubernetes API activity
5. **Cluster and Repository Statistics** - Monitor cluster cache age, resource objects, and Git operations
To get a details about metrics in each section, follow this [link](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/argocd/readme.md#sections).
This dashboard enables you to proactively monitor your GitOps workflow, identify potential issues before they impact your deployments, and ensure the smooth operation of your ArgoCD instance.

## Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing ArgoCD metrics in SigNoz, try the following steps:

1. **Verify endpoint accessibility**
   - Ensure the OpenTelemetry Collector can access the ArgoCD metrics endpoints
   - Check network policies or firewall rules that might be blocking access

2. **Check service discovery**
   - If using Kubernetes, make sure service names and ports are correct
   - Verify that the service selectors match the pod labels

3. **Inspect collector logs**
   - Look for any scrape errors in the OpenTelemetry Collector logs
   - Run `kubectl logs -n <namespace> <otel-collector-pod-name>` to check for any errors

4. **Validate metrics format**
   - Make sure ArgoCD is correctly exposing Prometheus-formatted metrics
   - Try accessing the metrics endpoints directly using port-forwarding:
     ```
     kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-metrics 8082:8082 -n argocd
     curl localhost:8082/metrics
     ```

5. **Check ArgoCD version**
   - Ensure you're using a version of ArgoCD that exposes metrics
   - Some metrics might be available only in specific versions
