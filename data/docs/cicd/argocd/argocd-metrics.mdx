## Overview


[ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that exposes metrics at several endpoints. Please read more about how to expose the metrics [here](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/metrics/).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. A running ArgoCD installation on your Kubernetes cluster
2. Access to your SigNoz Cloud account or a self-hosted SigNoz instance
3. OpenTelemetry Collector deployed in your environment
4. Your SigNoz ingestion key (for SigNoz Cloud users)

## Setup

### 1. Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector

To collect ArgoCD metrics and send them to SigNoz, you need to configure the OpenTelemetry Collector with a Prometheus receiver. Follow [this](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/).

#### Add Prometheus Receiver

Add the following configuration to the `receivers` section of your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file:

```yaml
prometheus:
  config:
    global:
      scrape_interval: 60s
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: argocd-metrics
        metrics_path: /metrics
        scheme: http
        static_configs:
          - targets:
            - localhost:8082  # Application metrics
            - localhost:8083  # API Server metrics
            - localhost:8084  # Repository Server metrics
```
Follow this [readme](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/argocd/readme.md) for more information.

 Replace `localhost` with appropriate hostnames or service names if your ArgoCD is running in a different namespace or cluster.
</Admonition>

### 2. Import the ArgoCD Dashboard in SigNoz

Once your ArgoCD metrics are flowing into SigNoz, you can utilize the pre-built ArgoCD dashboard to monitor your deployment.

1. Download the ArgoCD dashboard JSON from [SigNoz Dashboards Repository](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/argocd/argocd.json)

2. Import the dashboard in SigNoz:
   - Navigate to Dashboards in your SigNoz UI
   - Click on "Import Dashboard" in the top-right corner
   - Upload the downloaded JSON file
   - Click "Import"

For more information on importing and customizing dashboards, refer to the [SigNoz Dashboard Documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/dashboards/).

## Dashboard Features

The ArgoCD Dashboard in SigNoz provides comprehensive visibility into your ArgoCD deployment with the following features:

### Dashboard Variables

The dashboard includes variables that you can use to filter your data:

- `{{namespace}}`: Namespace of the application
- `{{health.status}}`: Health status of the application
- `{{repo}}`: Name of the repository

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you have successfully configured ArgoCD metrics collection and visualization in SigNoz. You now have comprehensive visibility into your ArgoCD deployment, including:

1. **Overall Status** - Monitor the number of applications and repository server status
2. **Application Health** - Track healthy, processing, suspended, and degraded applications
3. **Synchronization Status** - Monitor synced and out-of-sync applications
4. **Controller Performance** - Track sync activity, reconciliation metrics, and Kubernetes API activity
5. **Cluster and Repository Statistics** - Monitor cluster cache age, resource objects, and Git operations

This dashboard enables you to proactively monitor your GitOps workflow, identify potential issues before they impact your deployments, and ensure the smooth operation of your ArgoCD instance.

## Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing ArgoCD metrics in SigNoz, try the following steps:

1. **Verify endpoint accessibility**
   - Ensure the OpenTelemetry Collector can access the ArgoCD metrics endpoints
   - Check network policies or firewall rules that might be blocking access

2. **Check service discovery**
   - If using Kubernetes, make sure service names and ports are correct
   - Verify that the service selectors match the pod labels

3. **Inspect collector logs**
   - Look for any scrape errors in the OpenTelemetry Collector logs
   - Run `kubectl logs -n <namespace> <otel-collector-pod-name>` to check for any errors

4. **Validate metrics format**
   - Make sure ArgoCD is correctly exposing Prometheus-formatted metrics
   - Try accessing the metrics endpoints directly using port-forwarding:
     ```
     kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-metrics 8082:8082 -n argocd
     curl localhost:8082/metrics
     ```

5. **Check ArgoCD version**
   - Ensure you're using a version of ArgoCD that exposes metrics
   - Some metrics might be available only in specific versions

If you continue to experience issues, check the [SigNoz community forum](https://community.signoz.io/) or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues) for further assistance.
