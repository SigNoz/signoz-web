description: Instrument Jenkins with OpenTelemetry and send metrics to SigNoz
---

## Overview
[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is an automation server that enables developers to build, test, and deploy their applications through continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. This document will help you monitor your Jenkins build agents' metrics using SigNoz.

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins (>2.479)
- Jenkins pipelines that you want to monitor
- Jenkins OpenTelemetry [plugin] (https://signoz.io/docs/cicd/jenkins/jenkins-tracing/#install-and-configure-jenkins-opentelemetry-plugin) installed 
- Administrative access to Jenkins controller


## Setup

### Step 1: Install OTel agent metrics plugin
* For installing the plugin, please refer to [this documentation](https://plugins.jenkins.io/opentelemetry-agent-metrics/#plugin-content-web-ui-install)

### Step 2: Agent node configuration

#### Setup the executable source on the Jenkins Agent Nodes

In order for this plugin to work 2 executables are run on the agents **otel-contrib** and **node_exporter**

The binaries(depending on the Agent OS amd64/arm64) can be installed on the agents using any of the below methods
* present on the PATH of the agents
* downloaded from a URL on the agents. For this the global plugin option **Artifact download base URL** must be configured(refer the image below)
* uploaded from the Jenkins master. For this the executables must be manually stored under the JENKINS_HOME directory in the **opentelemetry-agent-metrics** subdirectory(subdirectory to be created under **JENKINS_HOME** of Jenkins Master)

More information about these executables and their setup can be found in this [document](https://plugins.jenkins.io/opentelemetry-agent-metrics/#plugin-content-setup-the-executable-source).

#### (Optional)Configure OTel agent metrics plugin
This configuration is required only when using Artifact download base URL to fetch the binaries

Now, navigate to **Manage Jenkins** -> **System** -> **onMonit** section

## View metrics in SigNoz

To see your metrics, head over to the **Metrics** Tab in your SigNoz UI and search for your metric.
