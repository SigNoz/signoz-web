title: Jenkins Host monitoring via OtelAgent plugin
description: Instrument Jenkins with OpenTelemetry and send traces & metrics to SigNoz
---

## Overview
This plugin integrates with the Opentelemetry Collector and Node exporter for monitoring of build agents.

It does this by deploying the Prometheus node exporter and Opentelemetry (Otel) Collector on job agents. The Otel Collector will scrape the metrics from node exporter. 

### Prerequisites

- [EventHub Setup](../../bootstrapping/data-ingestion)
- [Central Collector Setup](../../bootstrapping/collector-setup)
