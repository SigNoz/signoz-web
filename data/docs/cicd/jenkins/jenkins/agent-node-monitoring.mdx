## Overview

This documentation provides a detailed walkthrough on how to set up an AWS Lambda function to collect AWS Lambda logs stored in an AWS S3 bucket and forward them to 
SigNoz. This will enable you to automatically sends your Lambda logs to SigNoz, enabling you to visualize and monitor your application's 
load balancing performance and health.

**Here’s a quick summary of what we’ll be doing in this detailed documentation.**

   - After creating the bucket, navigate to the S3 Management Console.
   - Click on the **Upload** button.
   - Select the files you wish to upload from your local machine.
   - Optionally, configure settings like encryption, permissions, etc.
   - Click **Upload** to upload the selected files to the bucket.

3. **File Formats:**
   - You can upload files in various formats such as .json, .csv, .log, .gz, .zip, etc.
   - If you have configured Lambda logging, Lambda logs are automatically saved in `.log` format in your S3 bucket.
