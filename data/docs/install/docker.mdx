SigNoz can be installed on macOS or Linux computers, and there are two ways in which you can install SigNoz:

 - You may execute a script that checks your environment, installs Docker Engine and Docker Compose on Linux, and runs the `docker compose up` command for you. 
 - You may execute the `docker compose up` command yourself.

Both methods are provided below.

<Admonition type="info">
SigNoz recommends you to use the [install script](#install-signoz-using-the-install-script) on macOS and the following Linux distributions:
  - Ubuntu
  - Debian
  - OpenSuse
  - CentOS
  - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)

If you're using a different Linux distribution, see the [Install SigNoz Using Docker Compose](#install-signoz-using-docker-compose) section.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- A Linux or macOS machine. Microsoft Windows is not officially supported.
- On macOS, you must manually install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
before you run the install script. The install script automatically installs Docker Engine on Linux.
- A minimum of 4GB of memory must be allocated to Docker.
{ /* <!-- Existing documentation is somehow unclear. Are there different memory requirements based on the operating system? --> */}
- [Git client](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Ensure that the ports `3301`, `4317` and `4318` are open on the machine where you install SigNoz.

## Install SigNoz Using the Install Script

<Admonition type="info">
Please use non-root user (mainly for Git repository cloning), otherwise you may end up seeing file system permissions errors after the installation.
</Admonition>

1. <CloneRepo />

2. Run the `install.sh` script:
   ```bash
   cd deploy
   ./install.sh
   ```

## Install SigNoz Using Docker Compose

<Admonition type="info">
Before you install Signoz, ensure that [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is installed on your machine.
</Admonition>

1. <CloneRepo />

2. To install SigNoz, enter the `docker compose up` command, specifying the following:
    - `-f` and the path to your configuration file
    - `-d` to run containers in the background
    - `--remove-orphans` to remove orphaned containers

  ```bash
  cd deploy/docker
  docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
  ```

## Verify the Installation

1. Ensure that your containers are running correctly. To view the status of your containers, run the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```
  The output should look similar to the following:

```output
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                        COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                    PORTS                                    NAMES

```

2. Wait for all the pods to be in running state, and then point your browser to `http://<IP-ADDRESS>:3301/` to access the dashboard, replacing `<IP-ADDRESS>` with the IP address of the machine where you installed SigNoz.

  **Example**:
    - If you're running SigNoz on your local machine, you should point your browser to `http://localhost:3301/`.
    - If the IP address of the machine on which you're running SigNoz is `66.82.18.247`, you should point your browser to `http://66.82.18.247:3301/`

<RetentionInfo />

<Admonition type="info">
The `docker-compose.yaml` installs a sample application named [HotR.O.D](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/tree/master/examples/hotrod) that generates tracing data. You can explore the SigNoz dashboard with the data provided by the sample application. If you wish to remove the sample application, follow the steps in the [Remove the Sample Application](/docs/operate/docker-standalone/#remove-the-sample-application) section.
</Admonition>

## Install specific version of SigNoz

1. <CloneRepo />

2. Checkout to the specific version tag. For example, to install SigNoz version `v0.6.1`:
	```
	git checkout v0.6.1
	```

3. Run the `install.sh` script:

	```bash
	./install.sh
	```

Go to [Docker Standalone Operate](/docs/operate/docker-standalone) section for detailed instructions.

## Set Up Infra Agent

You can set up the Infra Agent to collect logs and metrics from your infrastructure.

1. Change directory to `deploy/docker/generator/infra`

  ```bash
  cd deploy/docker/generator/infra
  ```

2. Run the `docker compose up` command to start the Infra Agent:

  ```bash
  docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
  ```

3. Verify that the Infra Agent is running correctly. To view the status of your containers, run the following command:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

  The output should look similar to the following:

  ```output
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS         PORTS                       NAMES
  db63e4e2347f   gliderlabs/logspout:v3.2.14                    "/bin/logspout syslo…"   3 seconds ago    Up 1 second    80/tcp                      infra-logspout-1
  f0b9e641b74c   otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.111.0   "/otelcol-contrib --…"   3 seconds ago    Up 2 seconds   4317/tcp, 55678-55679/tcp   infra-otel-agent-1
  ```

4. _(Optional)_ To scrape metrics from other services using labels, you can add the following to your application's `docker-compose.yaml` file:

  ```yaml
  services:
    <service-name>:
      ...
      networks:
        - signoz-net
      labels:
        signoz.io/scrape: "true"
        signoz.io/port: "<port-where-metrics-are-exposed>"
        signoz.io/path: "/metrics"
  networks:
    signoz-net:
      name: signoz-net
      external: true
  ...
  ```

5. _(Optional)_ To stop the Infra Agent, run the following command:

  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```

## Set Up HOTRod Sample Application

You can set up the HOTRod sample application to generate tracing data.

1. Change directory to `deploy/docker/generator/hotrod`

  ```bash
  cd deploy/docker/generator/hotrod
  ```

2. Run the `docker compose up` command to start the HOTRod sample application:

  ```bash
  docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
  ```

3. Verify that the HOTRod sample application is running correctly. To view the status of your containers, run the following command:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
  
  The output should look similar to the following:

  ```output
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                 COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS        PORTS                     NAMES
  9c1b62e95ab4   jaegertracing/example-hotrod:1.61.0   "/go/bin/hotrod-linu…"   2 seconds ago    Up 1 second   8080-8083/tcp             hotrod
  ca46030b57fc   signoz/locust:1.2.3                   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   2 seconds ago    Up 1 second   5557-5558/tcp, 8089/tcp   load-hotrod
  ```

4. _(Optional)_ To stop the HOTRod sample application, run the following command:

  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```
