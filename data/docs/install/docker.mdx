SigNoz can be installed on macOS or Linux computers, and there are two ways in which you can install SigNoz:

 - You may execute a script that checks your environment, installs Docker Engine and Docker Compose on Linux, and runs the `docker compose up` command for you. 
 - You may execute the `docker compose up` command yourself.

Both methods are provided below.

<Admonition type="info">
SigNoz recommends you to use the [install script](#install-signoz-using-the-install-script) on macOS and the following Linux distributions:
  - Ubuntu
  - Debian
  - OpenSuse
  - CentOS
  - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)

If you're using a different Linux distribution, see the [Install SigNoz Using Docker Compose](#install-signoz-using-docker-compose) section.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- A Linux or macOS machine. Microsoft Windows is not officially supported.
- On macOS, you must manually install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
before you run the install script. The install script automatically installs Docker Engine on Linux.
- A minimum of 4GB of memory must be allocated to Docker.
{ /* <!-- Existing documentation is somehow unclear. Are there different memory requirements based on the operating system? --> */}
- [Git client](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Ensure that the ports `8080`, `4317` and `4318` are open on the machine where you install SigNoz.

## Install SigNoz Using the Install Script

<Admonition type="info">
Please use non-root user (mainly for Git repository cloning), otherwise you may end up seeing file system permissions errors after the installation.
</Admonition>

1. <CloneRepo />

2. Run the `install.sh` script:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

## Install SigNoz Using Docker Compose

<Admonition type="info">
Before you install SigNoz, ensure that [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is installed on your machine.
</Admonition>

1. <CloneRepo />

2. To install SigNoz, enter the `docker compose up` command, specifying the following:
    - `-f` and the path to your configuration file
    - `-d` to run containers in the background
    - `--remove-orphans` to remove orphaned containers

  ```bash
  cd docker
  docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
  ```

## Verify the Installation

1. Ensure that your containers are running correctly. To view the status of your containers, run the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```
  The output should look similar to the following:

```output
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                        COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                    PORTS                                    NAMES

```

2. Wait for all the pods to be in running state, and then point your browser to `http://<IP-ADDRESS>:8080/` to access the dashboard, replacing `<IP-ADDRESS>` with the IP address of the machine where you installed SigNoz.

  **Example**:
    - If you're running SigNoz on your local machine, you should point your browser to `http://localhost:8080/`.
    - If the IP address of the machine on which you're running SigNoz is `66.82.18.247`, you should point your browser to `http://66.82.18.247:8080/`

## Install specific version of SigNoz

1. <CloneRepo />

2. Checkout to the specific version tag. For example, to install SigNoz version `v0.6.1`:
	```
	git checkout v0.6.1
	```

3. Run the `install.sh` script:

	```bash
	./install.sh
	```
