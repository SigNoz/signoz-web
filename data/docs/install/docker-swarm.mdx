This section provides information on installing SigNoz on Docker Swarm.

## Prerequisites

{/* <!-- Double-check if this list is comprehensive about memory, disk space, etc. --> */}
{/* <!-- This section should focus on SigNoz, hence we could assume that Docker Swarm is already installed, similar to the Docker Standalone or Kubernetes sections. Not sure why we show to initialize a swarm or add more nodes here.  --> */}

- A Linux or macOS machine. Microsoft Windows is not officially supported.
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). A minimum of 4GB of memory
must be allocated to each Docker node.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git client](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Install SigNoz on Docker Swarm

<Admonition type="info">
Please use non-root user (mainly for Git repository cloning), otherwise you may end up seeing file system permissions errors after the installation.

1. <CloneRepo />

2. _(Optional)_ If you don't have a swarm cluster in place, you can create one by entering the following command:
    ```bash
    docker swarm init
    ```

    The output should look similar as shown below:
    ```output
    Swarm initialized: current node (6muco3j7jjuo6k4rbiq8yr8fw) is now a manager.

    To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-6ak6diq1lbrwemx17up9c1ph039h64z0dxksjxv647qnqrd290-4tt6q22dd462p4lf2n6bqbnt4 192.168.65.3:2377

    To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
    ```

3. _(Optional)_ You can use the `docker swarm join` command to add more nodes to the swarm.
    Note that the node you added in the previous step is the manager. For details, see the
    [Docker Swarm Join](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/swarm_join/)
    page of the Docker documentation.

4. Deploy SigNoz by entering the `docker stack deploy` command and specifying the following:
    - `-d` to deploy the stack in detached mode
    - `--prune` to remove services that are no longer referenced by the stack
    - `-c` and the path to the Swarm Compose file (`docker-compose.yaml`)
    - The name of the stack (`signoz`)

    ```bash
    cd deploy/docker
    docker stack deploy -d --prune -c docker-compose.yaml signoz
    ```

    The output should look similar to the following:

    ```output
    Creating network signoz-net
    Creating service signoz_query-service
    Creating service signoz_frontend
    Creating service signoz_otel-collector
    Creating service signoz_schema-migrator
    Creating service signoz_init-clickhouse
    Creating service signoz_zookeeper-1
    Creating service signoz_clickhouse
    Creating service signoz_alertmanager
    ```

5. _(Optional)_ By default, the instructions in this document create three replicas,
    and each replica can handle 50K spans per second. To handle an increased load,
    perform the steps in the [Scale Up](/docs/operate/docker-swarm/#scale-up) section
    of the [Operate on Docker Swarm](/docs/operate/docker-swarm/) page.

## Verify the Installation

1. Using the `docker stack services` command, monitor the SigNoz deployment process.
    Wait until all SigNoz services and replicas are created:

    ```bash
    docker stack services signoz
    ```

    You should see the following output:

    ```output
    ID             NAME                     MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                                        PORTS
    vpu9ub4rnr4g   signoz_alertmanager      replicated   1/1        signoz/alertmanager:0.23.7                   
    loqa6qbq7lk3   signoz_clickhouse        replicated   1/1        clickhouse/clickhouse-server:24.1.2-alpine   
    qjrn3lfxdvdn   signoz_frontend          replicated   1/1        signoz/frontend:0.69.0                       *:80->3301/tcp
    zqoee9ij9xh0   signoz_init-clickhouse   replicated   0/1        clickhouse/clickhouse-server:24.1.2-alpine   
    9awvkhh1feov   signoz_otel-collector    replicated   3/3        signoz/signoz-otel-collector:0.111.24        *:4317-4318->4317-4318/tcp
    eu5fbg0v1bps   signoz_query-service     replicated   1/1        signoz/query-service:0.69.0                  
    fcp7uk67tkks   signoz_schema-migrator   replicated   0/1        signoz/signoz-schema-migrator:0.111.24       
    nw6xukg1gkf7   signoz_zookeeper-1       replicated   1/1        bitnami/zookeeper:3.7.1                      

    ```

## Set Up Infra Agent

You can set up the Infra Agent to collect logs and metrics from your infrastructure.

1. Change directory to `deploy/docker-swarm/generator/infra`

  ```bash
  cd deploy/docker-swarm/generator/infra
  ```

2. Deploy the Infra Agent by running the `docker stack deploy` command:

  ```bash
  docker stack deploy -d --prune -c docker-compose.yaml signoz-infra
  ```

  The output should look similar to the following:

  ```output
  Creating service signoz-infra_infra-logspout
  Creating service signoz-infra_infra-otel-agent
  ```

3. Verify that the Infra Agent is running correctly. To view the status of your containers, run the following command:

  ```bash
  docker stack services infra
  ```

  The output should look similar to the following:

  ```output
  ID             NAME                 MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                                          PORTS
  k8gbgzz6u277   infra_logspout       global       2/2        gliderlabs/logspout:v3.2.14                    
  da9p8vg6ydu4   infra_otel-agent     global       2/2        otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.111.0   
  5ja92xi7im22   infra_otel-metrics   replicated   1/1        otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.111.0   
  ```

4. _(Optional)_ To scrape metrics from other services using labels, you can add the following to your application's `docker-compose.yaml` file:

  ```yaml
  services:
    <service-name>:
      ...
      deploy:
        labels:
          signoz.io/scrape: "true"
          signoz.io/port: "<port-where-metrics-are-exposed>"
          signoz.io/path: "/metrics"
  networks:
    signoz-net:
      name: signoz-net
      external: true
  ...
  ```

5. _(Optional)_ To stop the Infra Agent, run the following command:

  ```bash
  docker stack rm signoz-infra
  ```

## Set Up HOTRod Sample Application

You can set up the HOTRod sample application to generate tracing data.

1. Change directory to `deploy/docker-swarm/generator/hotrod`

  ```bash
  cd deploy/docker-swarm/generator/hotrod
  ```

2. Deploy the HOTRod sample application by running the `docker stack deploy` command:

  ```bash
  docker stack deploy -d --prune -c docker-compose.yaml hotrod
  ```

  The output should look similar to the following:

  ```output
  Creating service signoz_query-service
  Creating service signoz_frontend
  ```

3. Verify that the HOTRod sample application is running correctly. To view the status of your containers, run the following command:

  ```bash
  docker stack services hotrod
  ```

  The output should look similar to the following:

  ```output
  ID             NAME                 MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                                 PORTS
  ly84gnfxw3br   hotrod_hotrod        replicated   1/1        jaegertracing/example-hotrod:1.61.0   
  954b2gfskvlg   hotrod_load-hotrod   replicated   1/1        signoz/locust:1.2.3                   
  ```

4. _(Optional)_ To stop the HOTRod sample application, run the following command:

  ```bash
  docker stack rm hotrod
  ```
