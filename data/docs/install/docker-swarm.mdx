This section provides information on installing SigNoz on Docker Swarm.

## Prerequisites

{/* <!-- Double-check if this list is comprehensive about memory, disk space, etc. --> */}
{/* <!-- This section should focus on SigNoz, hence we could assume that Docker Swarm is already installed, similar to the Docker Standalone or Kubernetes sections. Not sure why we show to initialize a swarm or add more nodes here.  --> */}

- A Linux or macOS machine. Microsoft Windows is not officially supported.
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). A minimum of 4GB of memory
must be allocated to each Docker node.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git client](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Install SigNoz on Docker Swarm

Please use non-root user (mainly for Git repository cloning), otherwise you may end up seeing file system permissions errors after the installation.

2. _(Optional)_ If you don't have a swarm cluster in place, you can create one by entering the following command:
    ```bash
    docker swarm init
    ```

    The output should look similar as shown below:
    ```output
    Swarm initialized: current node (6muco3j7jjuo6k4rbiq8yr8fw) is now a manager.

    To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-6ak6diq1lbrwemx17up9c1ph039h64z0dxksjxv647qnqrd290-4tt6q22dd462p4lf2n6bqbnt4 192.168.65.3:2377

    To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
    ```

3. _(Optional)_ You can use the `docker swarm join` command to add more nodes to the swarm.
    Note that the node you added in the previous step is the manager. For details, see the
    [Docker Swarm Join](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/swarm_join/)
    page of the Docker documentation.

4. Deploy SigNoz by entering the `docker stack deploy` command and specifying the following:
    - `-d` to deploy the stack in detached mode
    - `--prune` to remove services that are no longer referenced by the stack
    - `-c` and the path to the Swarm Compose file (`docker-compose.yaml`)
    - The name of the stack (`signoz`)

    ```bash
    cd deploy/docker
    docker stack deploy -d --prune -c docker-compose.yaml signoz
    ```

    The output should look similar to the following:

    ```output
    Creating network signoz-net
    Creating service signoz_query-service
    Creating service signoz_frontend
    Creating service signoz_otel-collector
    Creating service signoz_schema-migrator
    Creating service signoz_init-clickhouse
    Creating service signoz_zookeeper-1
    Creating service signoz_clickhouse
    Creating service signoz_alertmanager
    ```

## Verify the Installation

1. Using the `docker stack services` command, monitor the SigNoz deployment process.
    Wait until all SigNoz services and replicas are created:

    ```bash
    docker stack services signoz
    ```

    You should see the following output:

    ```output
    ID             NAME                     MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                                        PORTS                  
    loqa6qbq7lk3   signoz_clickhouse        replicated   1/1        clickhouse/clickhouse-server:24.1.2-alpine
    zqoee9ij9xh0   signoz_init-clickhouse   replicated   0/1        clickhouse/clickhouse-server:24.1.2-alpine   
    9awvkhh1feov   signoz_otel-collector    replicated   3/3        signoz/signoz-otel-collector:0.111.24        *:4317-4318->4317-4318/tcp
    eu5fbg0v1bps   signoz_signoz            replicated   1/1        signoz/signoz:0.69.0                         *:80->8080/tcp                  
    fcp7uk67tkks   signoz_schema-migrator   replicated   0/1        signoz/signoz-schema-migrator:0.111.24       
    nw6xukg1gkf7   signoz_zookeeper-1       replicated   1/1        bitnami/zookeeper:3.7.1                      

    ```

## Scale Up SigNoz Cluster

SigNoz uses the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) to ingest data.
By default, the instructions in the [Install SigNoz on Docker Swarm](/docs/install/docker-swarm) document create
three replicas, and each replica can handle 50K spans per second. To handle an increased load, perform the following steps:

1. Open the `deploy/docker-swarm/docker-compose.yaml` file in a plain-text editor.

2. In the `services.otel-collector.deploy.replicas` field, enter the number of replicas you wish to create. The following example creates four replicas:

  ![Open Telemetry Collector - Create four replicas](/img/scale-up-otel.webp)

3. Update the `signoz` stack by entering the following command:

  ```bash
  docker stack deploy --prune -d -c docker-compose.yaml signoz
  ```
