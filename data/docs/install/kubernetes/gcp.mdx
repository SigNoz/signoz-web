## Prerequisites

<CommonPrerequisites />

## Install SigNoz

<K8sInstall />


## Additional Notes on GKE Autopilot

- For GKE Autopilot, the default storage class is `gce-resizable` and the cloud is `gcp/autogke`.

- GKE Autopilot automatically overriddes resource requests/limits. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the cluster has enough resource quota for the region where the cluster is deployed. Read more about it [here][3].


## (Optional) Install OpenTelemetry Demo
