description: Learn how to uninstall SigNoz across different deployment methods.
---

This document outlines the steps to uninstall SigNoz, covering various deployment methods such as Docker Standalone, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes.

## Docker Standalone

To uninstall SigNoz installed via Docker Standalone, use the following command:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

This command will stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes associated with the SigNoz deployment.

## Docker Swarm

To uninstall SigNoz deployed on Docker Swarm, use the following command:

```bash
docker stack rm signoz
```

This command will remove all services and resources associated with the SigNoz stack.

## Kubernetes

To uninstall SigNoz deployed on Kubernetes using Helm, follow these steps:

1.  **Uninstall Helm Release:**
    This command removes all Kubernetes components associated with the Helm chart and deletes the release, except for ClickHouse CRD resources.

    ```bash
    helm -n <namespace> uninstall "<release-name>"
    ```

    Refer to the [Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for more details on the `helm uninstall` command.

2.  **Delete ClickHouse CRD Resources:**
    If you are using ClickHouse managed by SigNoz, you might need to manually remove finalizers from ClickHouse CRD resources to ensure their complete deletion.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n <namespace> patch \
      clickhouseinstallations.clickhouse.altinity.com/<release-name>-clickhouse \
      -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
    ```

3.  **Delete Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):**
    The uninstallation process may not automatically delete associated PVCs. To clean them up, use the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n <namespace> delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<release-name>
    ```

4.  **Delete Namespace:**
    Finally, delete the namespace where SigNoz was installed:

    ```bash
    kubectl delete namespace <namespace>
    ```
