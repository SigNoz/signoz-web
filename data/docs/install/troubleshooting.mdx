This troubleshooting guide includes step-by-step instructions that should resolve most installation issues.

## Troubleshooting Docker Standalone Installation of SigNoz

1. Before you install SigNoz on Docker Standalone, ensure that all [prerequisites](/docs/install/docker/#prerequisites) are met.
2. Run the `docker ps` command and ensure that the `signoz-clickhouse` and `signoz-signoz` containers are running. If these containers are not running, increase the memory allocated to Docker.
3. If you don't see any data in the front-end, please wait two or three minutes.
4. Run the `install.sh` script again. The script will try to reinstall the containers that failed.
5. Follow the steps for [uninstalling SigNoz](/docs/operate/docker-standalone/#uninstall-signoz) section and then install SigNoz again by following the steps in the [Install SigNoz on Docker Standalone](/docs/install/docker) section.
6. If you're still facing issues trying to install SigNoz, please reach out to us on [Slack](https://signoz.io/slack) 

## Troubleshooting ClickHouse container crashes

If the clickhouse container is unable to start due to certain reasons, it is recommended to take the following steps before 
recreating the container

1. In the `deploy/docker` folder, run the following command to see more detailed logs for the ClickHouse container:
```bash
sudo docker-compose ps -a
``` 
This will show you the status of all containers, including ClickHouse.

- **Verify system resources:** Ensure your system has enough resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to run the ClickHouse container.

- **Check permissions:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to run Docker containers. Try running the installation script with sudo privileges.

- **Review Docker configuration:** Ensure your Docker installation is up-to-date and properly configured.

2. If the logs mention about `Permission denied` error, it is likely due to the correct permissions not set for the container.
3. Use the `chown` command to change the ownership for the files that clickhouse container is unable to access.
4. If neither of this works, run the `install.sh` script again as the root user or by using `sudo` as a prefix.

## SigNoz Otel Collector Address Grid

You might have specific set up for your application and SigNoz cluster.
It might not be very clear on which address to use to send data to SigNoz.

Here is the SigNoz Otel Collector address grid which could be helpful:

<table class="custom-table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2"></th>
            <th colspan="4">Where SigNoz is installed?</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    	<tr>
            <th colspan="2"></th>
        	<th>VM (Docker) - Same Machine</th>
            <th>VM (Docker) - Different Machine</th>
            <th>K8s (Same Cluster)</th>
            <th>K8s (Different Cluster)</th>
        </tr>
    	<tr>
            <th rowspan="4">Where your application is running?</th>
            <th>VM (native/binary)</th>
            <td>localhost:4317</td>
            <td>&lt;otelcollector-IP&gt;:4317</td>
            <td>&lt;k8s-node-IP>:&lt;otelcollector-node-port&gt;, &lt;k8s-loadbalancer-IP&gt;:4317</td>
            <td>&lt;k8s-node-IP>:&lt;otelcollector-node-port&gt;, &lt;k8s-loadbalancer-IP&gt;:4317</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>VM (Docker)</th>
            <td>172.17.0.1:4317, otel-collector:4317(shared network)</td>
            <td>&lt;otelcollector-IP&gt;:4317</td>
            <td>&lt;k8s-node-IP&gt;:&lt;otelcollector-node-port&gt;, &lt;k8s-loadbalancer-IP&gt;:4317</td>
            <td>&lt;k8s-node-IP&gt;:&lt;otelcollector-node-port&gt;, &lt;k8s-loadbalancer-IP&gt;:4317</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Kubernetes</th>
            <td>&lt;otelcollector-IP&gt;:4317</td>
            <td>&lt;otelcollector-IP&gt;:4317</td>
            <td>&lt;release-name&gt;-signoz-otel-collector.&lt;namespace&gt;.svc.cluster.local:4317</td>
            <td>&lt;k8s-node-IP&gt;:&lt;otelcollector-node-port&gt;, &lt;k8s-loadbalancer-IP&gt;:4317</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


<Admonition>
1. For the `<otelcollector-IP>`, use private IP address if the VM is in same private network.
2. Replace `<namespace>` with SigNoz namespace and `<release-name>` with SigNoz helm
  release name.
3. In the case of k8s where the application and SigNoz are running in different k8s cluster, you will have to expose otel collector service.
  Set the service type to either `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`.
</Admonition>

  ```
  helm upgrade --install -n platform my-release signoz/signoz \
  --set otelCollector.serviceType="<NodePort or LoadBalancer>"
  ```


## Container signoz-init-clickhouse Hangs Forever 

After installation, you might see sometime the `signoz-init-clickhouse` being stuck and from the logs it's shows:
```bash
docker logs signoz-init-clickhouse
# Fetching histogram-binary for linux/amd64
# Connecting to github.com (20.205.243.166:443)
```
This indicates the helper binary wasnâ€™t fetched from GitHub. For these issues you should, restart the SigNoz containers and allow time for the helper binary to download:

```bash
docker compose restart
```
