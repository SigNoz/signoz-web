### Q. How to setup SigNoz across different environments?

<details>

<summary> Toggle for answer </summary>

You can ingest data from across your environments just by adding `deployment.environment` resource attribute

On SDK level you can add it though environment variable
`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=deployment.environment=prod`

On collector level you can add it through a [resource](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/resourceprocessor/README.md) processor.
```yaml
processors:
  resource/env:
    attributes:
    - key: deployment.environment
      value: prod
      action: upsert
...
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      processors: [resource/env, batch]
```
