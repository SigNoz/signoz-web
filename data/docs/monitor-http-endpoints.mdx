<TabItem value="signoz-cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

## Basic Setup

### Step 1: Install OpenTelemetry Collector

Install and set up the OpenTelemetry Collector by following the [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/).

### Step 2: Configure the HTTP Check Receiver

Add the [httpcheck receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/httpcheckreceiver/documentation.md) to your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration:

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  httpcheck:
    targets:
      - endpoint: http://example.com //replace with the endpoint you want to monitor
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 10s

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<your-ingestion-key>"
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

### Step 3: Configure the Service Pipeline

Configure the service pipeline to include the httpcheck receiver:

```yaml:config.yaml
service:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, httpcheck]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### Step 4: Start the Collector

Start the OpenTelemetry Collector to begin collecting HTTP endpoint metrics:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317

## Understanding HTTP Check Metrics

The HTTP Check Receiver performs synthetic checks against HTTP endpoints by making requests to specified endpoints using the configured method. It generates metrics labeled for each HTTP response status class.

The receiver creates a metric named `httpcheck_status` with value 1 if the check resulted in status_code matching the status_class, otherwise 0.

## Monitoring Multiple Endpoints

You can configure multiple `targets` for the httpcheck receiver to monitor several endpoints simultaneously:

```yaml
receivers:
  httpcheck:
    targets:
      - endpoint: http://example.com
        method: GET
      - endpoint: http://my-app.com
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 10s
```

## Multiple Collection Intervals

If you need different collection intervals for different endpoints, create multiple httpcheck receiver instances. Each instance can have its own collection interval and targets:

```yaml
receivers:
  httpcheck/rapid:
    targets:
      - endpoint: http://critical-service.com
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 30s
  
  httpcheck/frequent:
    targets:
      - endpoint: http://important-service.com
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 60s
  
  httpcheck/low:
    targets:
      - endpoint: http://background-service.com
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 300s

service:
  metrics:
    receivers: [otlp, httpcheck/rapid, httpcheck/frequent, httpcheck/low]
    processors: [batch]
    exporters: [otlp] # or [clickhousemetricswrite] for self-host
```

**Note:** The receiver name format is `httpcheck` for the base receiver and `httpcheck/{name}` for additional instances. Using `httpchecklow` (without the slash) would return an error.

## Creating Dashboards in SigNoz

Once the collector is running and sending data to SigNoz, you can create dashboards to visualize HTTP endpoint health:

### Step 1: Create a New Dashboard

1. Navigate to your SigNoz account
2. Go to the **Dashboard** tab
3. Click on **New Dashboard** button
4. Choose **New Panel** and select **Time Series** chart type for HTTP endpoint monitoring

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/time-series-chart.webp" alt="Selecting Time Series chart type"/>
    <figcaption><i>Selecting Time Series chart type for HTTP monitoring</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Step 2: Configure the Query

1. In the **Query Builder** tab, enter "http" in the metric search
2. You should see `httpcheck.status` and other HTTP-related metrics

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/query-builder-metrics.webp" alt="HTTP metrics in Query Builder"/>
    <figcaption><i>HTTP metrics available in Query Builder</i></figcaption>
</figure>

3. Select `httpcheck.status` as your metric
4. Add a **WHERE** clause: `http.status_class = 2xx` to monitor successful responses

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/configure-query.webp" alt="Configuring httpcheck_status query"/>
    <figcaption><i>Configuring httpcheck.status query with WHERE clause</i></figcaption>
</figure>

5. You can also Average By specific endpoints using the `http.url` attribute

### Step 3: Visualize Endpoint Health

The resulting chart will show:
- Value of 1 when endpoints are healthy (returning 2xx status codes)
- Value of 0 when endpoints are down or returning error codes
- Different lines for each monitored endpoint

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/endpoint-health-chart.webp" alt="HTTP endpoint health visualization"/>

</figure>

## Available Metrics

The HTTP Check receiver provides several metrics:

| Metric | Description | Type |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `httpcheck.status` | HTTP response status (1 for matching status class, 0 otherwise) | Sum |
| `httpcheck.duration` | Duration of the HTTP request in milliseconds | Gauge |
| `httpcheck.error` | Number of errors during HTTP checks | Sum |

## Available Attributes

Key attributes for filtering and grouping:

| Attribute | Description | Example Values |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| `http.url` | Full HTTP request URL | `http://example.com`, `http://my-app.com/health` |
| `http.status_code` | HTTP response status code | `200`, `404`, `500` |
| `http.method` | HTTP request method | `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` |
| `http.status_class` | HTTP response status class | `2xx`, `4xx`, `5xx` |

For more details about the metrics and their related attributes, refer to the [HTTP Check Receiver documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/httpcheckreceiver/documentation.md).

## Setting Up Alerts

You can create alerts to get notified when endpoints go down:

### Step 1: Create Alert from Dashboard

1. In your dashboard panel showing HTTP endpoint health, click the dropdown menu
2. Select **Create Alerts**

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/create-alert-dropdown.webp" alt="Creating alert from dashboard panel"/>
    <figcaption><i>Creating alert from dashboard panel dropdown</i></figcaption>
</figure>

3. This will take you to the alerts configuration page

### Step 2: Configure Alert Conditions

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/alert-configuration.webp" alt="Alert configuration page"/>
    <figcaption><i>Alert configuration page with conditions setup</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Example alert configuration:
```yaml
Query: httpcheck_status{http_status_class="2xx"}
Condition: IS BELOW 1
Duration: 5m
```

This alert will trigger when any endpoint stops returning successful responses (2xx status codes) for more than 2 minutes.

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **No metrics appearing**: Check that the httpcheck receiver is included in the metrics pipeline
- **Permission errors**: Ensure the collector has network access to the target endpoints
- **SSL/TLS errors**: Configure appropriate TLS settings for HTTPS endpoints
- **High resource usage**: Reduce collection frequency for non-critical endpoints
