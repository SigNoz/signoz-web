With SigNoz, you can monitor the health of the HTTP endpoints and set up an alert in case of HTTP endpoint failure status codes.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

  * Add the httpcheck receiver to the config and set up the collector OTLP exporter to send data to SigNoz Cloud.

    ```yaml {2-6,9-14}
    receivers:
      httpcheck:
        targets:
          - endpoint: http://example.com
            method: GET
        collection_interval: 10s
    ...
    exporters:
      otlp:
        endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
        tls:
          insecure: false
        headers:
          "signoz-access-token": "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
    ...
    ```

    Depending on the choice of your region for the SigNoz cloud, the ingest endpoint will vary according to this table.

    | Region | Endpoint |
    | --- | --- |
    | US |  ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
    | IN |  ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
    | EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

    The HTTP Check Receiver can be used for synthetic checks against HTTP endpoints. This receiver will make a request to the specified endpoint using the configured method. This scraper generates a metric labelled for each HTTP response status class with a value of 1 if the status code matches the class.

  * Next, we will modify the pipeline to include the receiver we have enabled above.

      ```yaml {4}
      service:
          ....
          metrics:
            receivers: [otlp, httpcheck]
            processors: [batch]
            exporters: [otlp]
      ```

  * We can restart the otel collector container/process so that new changes are applied and see the metrics generated for synthetic checks.

  * This receiver creates a metric name `httpcheck_status` with value 1 if the check resulted in status_code matching the status_class, otherwise 0. For more info on the additional metrics and attributes available, please read the documentation [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/httpcheckreceiver/documentation.md).


#### Monitoring the Health of Multiple Endpoints

  You can configure `targets` for the httpcheck receiver to monitor the health of one or more endpoints. Following is the sample config that monitors two endpoints.
  

  ```yaml {2-8,11-16,21,23}
  receivers:
    httpcheck:
      targets:
        - endpoint: http://example.com
          method: GET
        - endpoint: http://my-app.com
          method: GET
      collection_interval: 10s
...
  exporters:
    otlp:
      endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
      tls:
        insecure: false
      headers:
        "signoz-access-token": "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
  ...
    service:
        ....
        metrics:
          receivers: [otlp, httpcheck]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [otlp]
  ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="self-host" label="Self-Host" default>

* Add the httpcheck receiver to the config file
  ```yaml {2-10}
  receivers:
    httpcheck:
      targets:
        - endpoint: http://example.com
          method: GET
      collection_interval: 10s
  ```

#### Monitoring the Health of Multiple Endpoints

  You can configure `targets` for the httpcheck receiver to monitor the health of multiple endpoints. Following is the sample config that monitors two endpoints.

  ```yaml {2-8}
  receivers:
    httpcheck:
      targets:
        - endpoint: http://example.com
          method: GET
        - endpoint: http://my-app.com
          method: GET
      collection_interval: 10s
...
  ...

    service:
        ....
        metrics:
          receivers: [otlp, httpcheck]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [clickhousemetricswrite]
  ```
