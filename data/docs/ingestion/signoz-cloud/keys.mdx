Limits and Restrictions:
- Only administrators can manage Ingestion keys.
- There is a maximum limit of 50 Ingestion keys per account.
- Key names must be unique within your account.

## Modify Ingestion Keys
To modify an existing SigNoz Ingestion key, navigate to Settings > Ingestion Settings and click the edit icon next to the relevant key. Please note that only the expiry date and tags can be modified.

## Remove Ingestion Keys
To remove a SigNoz Ingestion key, go to **Settings > Ingestion Settings**. Users with the appropriate permissions can click the Trash icon next to the key they wish to remove. A confirmation prompt will appear before the key is deleted. Please be aware that this action is irreversible and will immediately revoke the Ingestion key.

## Add Limits to a Key
SigNoz offers the flexibility to set limits on your Ingestion keys. To add a limit to an existing key:

1. Click on the target key to open its dropdown menu.
2. In the dropdown, select the **signal** to which you want to apply the limit.
3. Click on **+ Limits**.
4. Specify an appropriate limit value.
5. Click on **Save**.

## Modify a Limit
To modify an existing limit, navigate to the Ingestion key and click the edit option corresponding to the limit in question. It's important to note that modifying a limit does not reset the accumulated values. For example, if the initial limit was 20GB/day and you've used 15GB before increasing the limit to 25GB/day, the usage count will continue from 15GB.

## Remove a Limit
To remove a limit, navigate to the Ingestion key and click the delete option next to the relevant limit. Deleting a limit will reset all accumulated values. For instance, if the limit was set to 20GB/day and you've used 15GB before deleting the limit, the counter will be reset to 0. Any new limit created thereafter will start from 0.
