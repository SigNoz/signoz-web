- **Deployments View**: Tracks deployment statuses, availability, and resource consumption.
- **Jobs, DaemonSets, StatefulSets, and Volumes Views**: Enable monitoring of specific Kubernetes workloads.

By default, the **Pods View** is selected, offering a detailed breakdown of pod-level resource utilization.


### Pods View: Monitoring Kubernetes Pods

The **Pods View** provides real-time visibility into pod resource utilization, enabling users to track CPU, memory, and network performance.

#### Table Columns

- **Pod Name**: Name of the Kubernetes pod.
