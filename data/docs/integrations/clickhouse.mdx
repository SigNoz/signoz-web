## Overview

This integration helps you monitor key Clickhouse metrics and logs, view them with an out-of-the-box dashboard, and collect query logs for better querying and aggregation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. A Clickhouse server running version 23 or newer
2. An OpenTelemetry (OTEL) Collector with access to the Clickhouse server
   - [Install the SigNoz OTEL Collector](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) (v0.88.0 or newer, v0.88.23+ for query log collection) if not done already 
   - Ensure you can provide config files and set environment variables for the collector
   - Ensure the OTEL collector has access to the Clickhouse server for metrics collection and can read the Clickhouse server log file for logs collection

## Preparing Clickhouse Server

### Check Clickhouse Version

Ensure your Clickhouse server is running a supported version (v23 or newer):

```SQL
SELECT version();
