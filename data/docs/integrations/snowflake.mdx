## Overview

This integration helps you to monitor key Snowflake metrics, and view them with an out-of-the-box dashboard.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. A Snowflake account
2. An OpenTelemetry (OTEL) Collector with access to Snowflake
   - [Install the OTEL Collector](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/)(v0.88.0 or newer) if not done already 
   - Ensure you can provide config files and set environment variables for the collector

## Setup

### Step 1: Create the Collector Config File

Create a file named `snowflake-metrics-collection-config.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml:snowflake-metrics-collection-config.yaml
receivers:
  snowflake:
    account: ${env:SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT}
    username: ${env:SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME}
    password: ${env:SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD}
    warehouse: ${env:SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE}
    collection_interval: 5m
    metrics:
      snowflake.database.bytes_scanned.avg:
        enabled: true
      snowflake.query.bytes_deleted.avg:
        enabled: true

processors:
  # enriches the data with additional host information
  # see https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/resourcedetectionprocessor#resource-detection-processor
  resourcedetection/system:
    # add additional detectors if needed
    detectors: ["system"]

exporters:
  # export to SigNoz cloud
  otlp/snowflake:
    endpoint: "${env:OTLP_DESTINATION_ENDPOINT}"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "${env:SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY}"

  # export to local collector
  # otlp/snowflake:
  #   endpoint: "localhost:4317"
  #   tls:
  #     insecure: true

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics/snowflake:
      receivers: [snowflake]
      processors: [resourcedetection/system]
      exporters: [otlp/snowflake]
```

All the available Snowflake receiver configurations can be found [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/snowflakereceiver/config.go).

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash

# Snowflake account from where the metrics need to be collected
export SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT="<organization>-<account-name>"

# Snowflake username used while logging in into the Snowflake account
export SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME="<snowflake-username>"

# Password for the corresponding Snowflake user used while logging in into the Snowflake account
export SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD="<snowflake-password>"

# Snowflake warehouse
export SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE="<snowflake-warehouse>"

# region specific SigNoz cloud ingestion endpoint
export OTLP_DESTINATION_ENDPOINT="ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"

# your SigNoz ingestion key
export SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY="<your-ingestion-key>"
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

### Step 3: Use the Collector Config File

Add the following flag to your collector run command:
```bash
--config snowflake-metrics-collection-config.yaml
```

## Snowflake Dashboard

You can import the Snowflake dashboard.

Go to Dashboards => New Dashboard => Import JSON

Download JSON from [link](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/snowflake/snowflake-otlp-v1.json).

Here are sample screenshots from the dashboard:
