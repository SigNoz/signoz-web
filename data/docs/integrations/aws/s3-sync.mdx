title: Sync Logs from S3 Buckets

## Overview

The **S3 Sync** feature in SigNoz enables seamless ingestion of log files from 
your Amazon S3 buckets into the SigNoz. 
This integration leverages AWS services such as EventBridge and Lambda to detect
and forward new log files, ensuring real-time log analysis and monitoring for services like MSK, VPC, and other 
service whose logs are stored in S3 buckets.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the AWS S3 Sync integration, ensure the following:
- **AWS Account Access**: Administrative access to your AWS account with permissions to create IAM roles, ECS cluster, and others.
- **S3 Buckets**: Identify the S3 buckets and their respective AWS regions from which you want to sync logs. Log files must be in `.log.gz` extension.

## Setup

### Step 1. Install the Integration Agent
Begin by installing the SigNoz Integration Agent using SigNoz-provided AWS 
CloudFormation Template. This template establishes the required IAM roles and 
permissions, allowing the Integration Agent to interact with your S3 buckets 
and related AWS services.

### Step 2. Enable S3 Sync in SigNoz UI
Navigate to the SigNoz user interface:

- Go to **Integrations** â†’ **Amazon Web Services**.
- Select **S3 Sync** and click **Enable Log Collection**.
- Configure the S3 buckets by specifying:
   - **Bucket Name**: Exact name of the S3 bucket (e.g., `my-app-logs-bucket`)  
   - **Region**: AWS region where the bucket is located

You can only sync logs from regions that are enabled in Account Settings.

The Integration Agent will receive this configuration and proceed with the setup.

### Step 3. Automatic Setup by Integration Agent

Upon receiving the configuration, the Integration Agent automatically creates the following resources in each specified region:

- **EventBridge Configuration**: The agent enables EventBridge notifications on the specified S3 buckets.
- **Event Filtering**: It sets up event filters to monitor for new files within specific buckets.
- **ECR Repository**: Creates an ECR repository to store the Lambda function container image (sourced from DockerHub due to AWS Lambda limitations).
- **Lambda Function**: Deploys a Lambda function established by the CloudFormation Template. This function processes new log files.

### 4. Log Ingestion Process

When a new `.log.gz` file is added to the specified S3 buckets, then:

- EventBridge will detect the new file and trigger the Lambda function.
- The Lambda function will read the log file and forward its contents to the SigNoz Ingestion endpoint, making them available for analysis and processing.

## Considerations
- **File Naming Convention**: Ensure that log files intended for synchronization have the `.log.gz` extension.
- **Permissions**: Do not modify the IAM roles created by the CloudFormation template. They are needed for the integration to work as expected.
- **Region Specificity**: Each S3 bucket must be configured in its correct AWS region.

## Troubleshooting

- **Logs Not Appearing in SigNoz**:
    - Verify S3 bucket names exactly match those configured in the SigNoz UI (case-sensitive).
    - Check AWS CloudWatch logs for the Lambda function (signoz-forwarder) to identify any errors.
    - Ensure that the `.log.gz` files are correctly formatted and compressed.
- **Permission Issues**:
    - Verify that the IAM roles created by the CloudFormation Template have the necessary permissions to access the S3 buckets and invoke the Lambda function.
    - Review the Integration Agent's access to AWS credentials and permissions.
