## Overview

Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. Monitoring ECS is crucial for:

- **Performance Optimization**: Track resource utilization across clusters and services
- **Cost Management**: Monitor CPU and memory usage to optimize container sizing
- **Troubleshooting**: Quickly identify and resolve issues with container deployments
- **Capacity Planning**: Understand usage patterns to plan future capacity needs

## What You'll Monitor

This integration collects key ECS metrics and logs, providing visibility into:

### Core ECS Metrics
- **CPU Utilization**: Monitor CPU usage at cluster, service, and task levels
- **Memory Utilization**: Track memory consumption and identify memory leaks
- **Network I/O**: Monitor network traffic for performance optimization
- **Task Status**: Track running, pending, and stopped tasks
- **Service Health**: Monitor service stability and deployment status

### Container Insights Metrics (when enabled)
When AWS Container Insights is enabled for your ECS resources, this integration also collects enhanced metrics including:
- **Container-level resource utilization**
- **Task-level performance metrics**
- **Network and storage metrics**
- **Enhanced troubleshooting data**

### ECS Logs
- **Container logs**: Application logs from your ECS tasks
- **ECS agent logs**: Infrastructure-level logging
- **Service event logs**: ECS service lifecycle events

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the ECS integration, ensure you have:

1. **AWS Account Access**: Administrative access to your AWS account
2. **ECS Resources**: Active ECS clusters, services, and tasks to monitor
3. **SigNoz Account**: Access to SigNoz (Cloud or Self-hosted)
4. **IAM Permissions**: Ability to create IAM roles and CloudFormation stacks

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Access the Integration

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** tab in your SigNoz dashboard
2. Search for "ECS" or browse the AWS services section
3. Click on the **AWS ECS** integration tile

    <figcaption><i>Select ECS from Services for Integration</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Step 2: Configure the Integration

1. **Select AWS Region**: Choose the region where your integration agent will be installed
2. **Choose Regions to Monitor**: Select one or more AWS regions containing your ECS resources
3. **Configure Collection Options**:
   - **Metric Collection**: Enable to collect ECS CloudWatch metrics (recommended)
   - **Log Collection**: Enable to collect ECS container and service logs

</figure>

### Step 3: Deploy the Integration Agent

1. **Launch CloudFormation Stack**: Click the "Launch Stack" button to open AWS CloudFormation
2. **Review Parameters**: The stack template comes pre-filled with your SigNoz account details
3. **Acknowledge Permissions**: Review and acknowledge the IAM permissions required
4. **Create Stack**: Deploy the CloudFormation stack

The CloudFormation stack will automatically create:
- IAM roles with appropriate permissions
- CloudWatch Metric Streams for ECS metrics
- Log Groups and Log Streams for ECS logs
- Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams
- Lambda functions for log processing (if needed)

### Step 4: Verify Data Collection

Once the CloudFormation stack deployment is complete:

1. **Check Integration Status**: The integration status should change to "Connected"
2. **View Collected Data**: Navigate to the "Data Collected" tab to see available metrics and logs
3. **Access Dashboard**: Go to the Dashboards section to view your ECS monitoring dashboard

    <figcaption><i>AWS ECS Overview Dashboard</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Key visualizations include:**
- **Memory Utilization**: Maximum and minimum memory usage trends
- **CPU Utilization**: Maximum and minimum CPU usage trends
- **Resource trends**: Time-series graphs showing resource usage over time
- **Cluster and service filtering**: Filter metrics by specific clusters and services

### ECS Container Insights Dashboard

For enhanced monitoring with Container Insights enabled:

    <figcaption><i>ECS Container Insights Dashboard</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Additional metrics include:**
- **CPU Usage and Reserved**: Real-time CPU metrics
- **Memory Usage and Reserved**: Memory allocation and utilization
- **Network I/O**: Network receive and transmit metrics  
- **Storage I/O**: Storage read and write operations

aws ecs put-account-setting --name "containerInsights" --value "enabled"
```

### 2. Resource Tagging
Tag your ECS resources consistently for better filtering and organization in dashboards:
```json
{
  "Environment": "production",
  "Service": "web-app",
  "Team": "backend"
}
```

### 3. Log Management
- Configure appropriate log retention policies to manage costs
- Use structured logging in your applications for better parsing
- Consider using log aggregation at the service level

### 4. Alerting Setup
Set up alerts for critical metrics:
- High CPU/memory utilization (>80%)
- Failed task deployments
- Service unhealthy status
- Container restart frequency

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Not Connecting
- Verify CloudFormation stack deployed successfully
- Check IAM permissions are correctly configured
- Ensure selected regions have ECS resources

### Missing Metrics
- Confirm ECS services are actively running
- Verify Container Insights is enabled for enhanced metrics
- Check CloudWatch Metric Streams are functioning

### No Log Data
- Ensure ECS tasks are configured to send logs to CloudWatch
- Verify log group names match the integration configuration
- Check Firehose delivery stream status
