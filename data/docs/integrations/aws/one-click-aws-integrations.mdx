# AWS Integrations with AutoDiscovery

Monitoring your AWS infrastructure can quickly become complex especially when dealing with multiple services and regions. SigNoz's Native AWS Integrations with 
AutoDiscovery simplifies this process by providing a one-click solution to ingest CloudWatch metrics and logs directly into SigNoz. It automates the entire process, 
from setup to continuous auto-discovery, ensuring users get all their logs and metrics into SigNoz seamlessly.

## The Challenge: Manual AWS Monitoring Setup

Traditionally, setting up AWS monitoring involves:
- Manually configuring AWS components like CloudWatch, metric streams and log subscriptions
- Managing multiple AWS accounts and regions
- Performing ongoing maintenance to track new services
- Requiring deep AWS expertise, making monitoring a complex side quest for developers

This process adds overhead and often turns observability into a burden rather than a seamless experience.

## The Solution: One-Click AWS Integration

SigNoz one-click AWS integration that removes all manual configuration and maintenance. Users can integrate AWS accounts with SigNoz in just a few clicks by:

1. Selecting the AWS regions to monitor
2. Deploying the AWS Integration Agent using CloudFormation
3. The agent automatically configures all necessary AWS components to collect logs and metrics

## Key Features

### Seamless AWS Account Connection
SigNoz allows users to integrate AWS accounts effortlessly. After selecting the AWS regions to monitor, the AWS Integration Agent is deployed using CloudFormation. 
Once installed, the agent automatically configures all required AWS components, eliminating the need for manual setup.

### AutoDiscovery for AWS Resources
One of the biggest pain points in AWS monitoring is ensuring new service instances are automatically tracked. With SigNoz's AutoDiscovery, the agent:
- Detects new AWS services and instances in real time
- Automatically creates CloudWatch log subscriptions for newly added resources
- Eliminates the need for manual configuration updates whenever infrastructure changes

### Pre-Built Dashboards for AWS Services
SigNoz provides ready-to-use dashboards that instantly visualize key AWS service metrics.

These dashboards are locked by default.

### Multi-Region & Multi-Account Support
SigNoz makes it easy to monitor AWS services across multiple regions and accounts:
- Enable monitoring for additional AWS regions with a single click
- No need to manually configure each region
- Multiple AWS accounts can be connected and managed in one centralized observability platform

### Uninstallation & Cleanup
Unlike traditional AWS monitoring setups that require manual deprovisioning, SigNoz simplifies removal:
- Disabling AWS monitoring removes all associated configurations
- The agent cleans up all created resources automatically
- You just need to remove the agent manually after it has cleaned up all configurations

## Getting Started

Before starting, ensure you have necessary permissions and access to your AWS account.

### Step 1: Choose Service and Connect Your AWS Account

1. Select services to monitor (Ex. Lambda, ECS, EKS etc)
2. **Choose the region** to install the integration agent
3. **Select regions to monitor** â€“ You can monitor one or more enabled AWS regions
4. **Launch the CloudFormation stack**:
   - Pre-filled with required parameters
   - Acknowledge permissions
   - Deploy the stack

    <figcaption><i>CloudFormation Template with pre-filled details of SigNoz account</i></figcaption>
</figure>

This creates:
- IAM roles
- Log group for logs
- Firehose delivery streams
- Metrics streams

The agent will:
- Auto-detect namespaces (e.g., `AWS/RDS`)
- Identify relevant log groups (e.g., `/aws/rds/...`)
- Set up CloudWatch Metric Streams and Log Subscriptions
- Provision Firehose streams to send data to SigNoz


### Step 2: View Data in SigNoz

- Status updates to **Connected** once ingestion begins
- Access pre-built [dashboards](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/) 
- [Logs](https://signoz.io/docs/product-features/logs-explorer/) and [metrics](https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/metrics-explorer/) start streaming within minutes

## Step 3: (Optional) Add More Regions or Services

Need to expand?

- Open the integration UI
- Go to account settings and select new regions
- The agent will deploy new telemetry stacks automatically

</figure>


## Step 4: (Optional) Add another AWS account

Need to expand?

- Open the integration UI
- Check additional regions or services
- The agent will deploy new telemetry stacks automatically

## What's Next? 

The AWS Integration Agent is just the beginning. Planned expansions include:
- Support for more AWS services
- Advanced log parsing and analytics for AWS logs
- Expanding integrations to GCP and Azure for multi-cloud observability
