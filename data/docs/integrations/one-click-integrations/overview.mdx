# AWS Integrations with AutoDiscovery

SigNoz's Native AWS Integrations with AutoDiscovery eliminates the complexity of manually configuring AWS monitoring, making it effortless to monitor AWS services with minimal effort. The AWS Integration Agent automates the entire process, from setup to continuous auto-discovery, ensuring users get all their logs and metrics into SigNoz seamlessly.

## The Challenge: Manual AWS Monitoring Setup

Traditionally, setting up AWS monitoring involves:
- Manually configuring AWS components like CloudWatch metric streams and log subscriptions
- Managing multiple AWS accounts and regions
- Performing ongoing maintenance to track new services
- Requiring deep AWS expertise, making monitoring a complex side quest for developers

This process adds overhead and often turns observability into an unwelcome burden rather than a seamless experience.

## The Solution: One-Click AWS Integration

SigNoz introduces a one-click AWS integration that removes all manual configuration and maintenance. Users can integrate AWS accounts with SigNoz in just a few clicks by:

1. Selecting the AWS regions to monitor
2. Deploying the AWS Integration Agent using CloudFormation
3. The agent automatically configures all necessary AWS components to collect logs and metrics

## Key Features

### Seamless AWS Account Connection
SigNoz allows users to integrate AWS accounts effortlessly. After selecting the AWS regions to monitor, the AWS Integration Agent is deployed using CloudFormation. Once installed, the agent automatically configures all required AWS components, eliminating the need for manual setup.

### AutoDiscovery for AWS Resources
One of the biggest pain points in AWS monitoring is ensuring new service instances are automatically tracked. With SigNoz's AutoDiscovery, the agent:
- Detects new AWS services and instances in real time
- Automatically creates CloudWatch log subscriptions for newly added resources
- Eliminates the need for manual configuration updates whenever infrastructure changes

### Pre-Built Dashboards for AWS Services
SigNoz provides ready-to-use dashboards that instantly visualize key AWS metrics, including:

**EC2 Monitoring:**
- CPU utilization
- Disk usage
- Network performance

**RDS Monitoring:**
- CPU metrics
- Memory usage
- Database connections
- Disk reads/writes

*More AWS services will continue to be added.*

### Multi-Region & Multi-Account Support
SigNoz makes it easy to monitor AWS services across multiple regions and accounts:
- Enable monitoring for additional AWS regions with a single click
- No need to manually configure each region
- Multiple AWS accounts can be connected and managed in one centralized observability platform

### One-Click Uninstallation & Cleanup
Unlike traditional AWS monitoring setups that require manual deprovisioning, SigNoz simplifies removal:
- Disabling AWS monitoring removes all associated configurations
- The agent cleans up all created resources automatically
- Prevents lingering costs and complexity
- You just need to remove the agent manually after it has cleaned up all configurations

## Getting Started

We've currently rolled out AWS Monitoring to our beta users and it will soon be live for all users. You can get started with AWS monitoring in SigNoz by following the docs [here](https://signoz.io/docs/ec2-monitoring/).

You can also use the guided onboarding that we have in our cloud product.

## What's Next? Expanding AWS & Cloud Integrations

The AWS Integration Agent is just the beginning. Planned expansions include:
- Support for more AWS services (e.g., Lambda, Aurora, DynamoDB)
- Advanced log parsing and analytics for AWS logs
- Expanding integrations to GCP and Azure for multi-cloud observability

## When to Use & Key Benefits

AWS Integrations with AutoDiscovery can deliver specific benefits in these common scenarios:

- **During incident response:** Quickly identify if AWS infrastructure issues are affecting your applications through unified visibility of all AWS services and instant identification of error-prone resources.

- **When investigating performance bottlenecks:** Determine if slow response times are due to your application code or AWS infrastructure using comprehensive monitoring that correlates application metrics with AWS service performance.

- **For proactive monitoring:** Keep an eye on critical AWS infrastructure with comprehensive performance insights that track resource utilization trends and patterns across all AWS dependencies.

- **Infrastructure scaling decisions:** Monitor resource usage patterns to make informed decisions about scaling AWS resources up or down based on actual usage data.
