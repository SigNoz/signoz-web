## Prerequisites

* [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with administrative privilege or Monitoring Admin and Compute Engine Admin privilege
* Cloud Run Admin and Artifact Registry Admin in case you want to setup Cloud Run service to create an uptime check
* [SigNoz Cloud Account](https://signoz.io/teams/) (we are using SigNoz Cloud for this demonstration, we will also need ingestion details. To get your **Ingestion Key** and **Ingestion URL,** sign-in to your SigNoz Cloud Account and go to **Settings** >> **Ingestion Settings**)
* Access to a project in GCP

## Setup

### Create Uptime Check for Cloud Run service

In case you want to create a Cloud Run service, follow the [Cloud Run Service Setup](/docs/gcp-monitoring/cloud-run/cloud-run-setup) document for detailed steps.

To setup uptime check on the Cloud Run service:

Step 1: On the GCP console, search for "Uptime checks", and naviagte to `Uptime checks` under the Monitoring service from the dropdown.

Step 2: On the `Uptime checks` page, click on **Create uptime check** button at the top.

</figure>

Step 3: Select the **Protocol** as `HTTPS`, **Resource type** as `Cloud Run Service`. From the `Cloud Run Service` dropdown that appears, choose the appropriate service. 
In the **Path** provide `/`. **Frequency** can be adjusted as per your requirement. In this case, we will go with the default `1 minute`. Click on `Continue`.

        alt="Create uptime check - Response Codes"
    />
<figcaption>
<i>

    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/cloud-monitoring/metrics/create-uptime-check-alert-creation.webp"
        alt="Create uptime check - Alert Creation"
    />
<figcaption>

</figure>

Step 6: Give an appropriate title to the uptime check. Click on `Test`. The uptime check should be successful with 200 response.
Once tested, you can create the uptime check.

<figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/cloud-monitoring/metrics/create-uptime-check-test.webp"
        alt="Test the uptime check"
    />
<figcaption>
<i>

</i>
</figcaption>
</figure>

The uptime check is created, and from here on, the metrics will start getting emitted for Cloud Run service's uptime check.

### Deploy Telegraf to fetch the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring

You will need a Compute Engine instance to install Telegraf and OTel Collector. You can follow the instructions on the [Creating Compute Engine](/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation) document to create the Compute Engine instance.

**Step 1:** Install [`telegraf`](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) which will collect metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring. The installation process for the respective operating system can be found in official [documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1/install/).

After successful installation, the `telegraf` status should be active and running.

<figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/cloud-monitoring/metrics/telegraf-status.webp"
        alt="Telegraf running status"
    />
<figcaption>
<i>
`telegraf` running status
</i>
</figcaption>
</figure>

The configuration file for telegraf can be found here:

```sh
/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf
```

**Step 2:** Configure the Telegraf input and output plugin by adding configurations to the `telegraf.conf` file.

```txt
# Gather timeseries from Google Cloud Platform v3 monitoring API
[[inputs.stackdriver]]
  ## GCP Project
  project = "omni-new"
  ## Include timeseries that start with the given metric type.
  metric_type_prefix_include = [
    "monitoring.googleapis.com",
  ]
  ## Most metrics are updated no more than once per minute; it is recommended
  ## to override the agent level interval with a value of 1m or greater.
  interval = "1m"
# Send OpenTelemetry metrics over gRPC
[[outputs.opentelemetry]]
  ## Override the default (localhost:4317) OpenTelemetry gRPC service
  ## address:port
  service_address = "localhost:4317"
```

We are assuming that the OTel Collector is running on the same machine as Telegraf. If that is not the case, you will have to change the `service_address` in the `outputs.opentelemetry` section accordingly.

## Deploy OpenTelemetry to scrape the metrics from Telegraf

**Step 1:** Install and configure OpenTelemetry for scraping the metrics from Telegraf. Follow [OpenTelemetry Binary Usage in Virtual Machine](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) guide for detailed instructions.

**Step 2:** After successful configuration start the OTel Collector using following command:

```sh
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

**Step 3:** Restart the Telegraf service

**Step 4:** If the configurations are configured correctly with Telegraf and we can see the output logs from OpenTelemetry as follows:

        alt="OTel Collector Logs"
    />
<figcaption>
<i>

</figcaption>
</figure>

## Send and Visualize the metrics obtained by OpenTelemetry in SigNoz

**Step 1:** Go to the SigNoz Cloud URL and head over to the dashboard.

**Step 2:** If not already created, create a new dashboard and select Time Series.

<figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/cloud-monitoring/metrics/new-panel.webp"
        alt="Creating new panel"
    />
<figcaption>
<i>

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any problems while setting up monitoring for your Cloud Monitoring's metrics with SigNoz, consider these troubleshooting steps:

* **Verify Configuration**: Double-check your `config.yaml` file to ensure all settings, including the ingestion key and endpoint, are correct.
* **Review Logs**: Look at the logs of both Telegraf and the OpenTelemetry Collector to identify any error messages or warnings that might provide insights into what’s going wrong.
* **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all relevant packages and dependencies are up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.
* **Consult Documentation**: Review the SigNoz, OpenTelemetry, and Telegraf documentation for any additional troubleshooting of the common issues.

</figure>

The configuration file for telegraf can be found here:

```sh
/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf
```

**Step 2:** Configure the Telegraf input and output plugin by adding configurations to the `telegraf.conf` file.

```txt
# Gather timeseries from Google Cloud Platform v3 monitoring API
[[inputs.stackdriver]]
  ## GCP Project
  project = "omni-new"
  ## Include timeseries that start with the given metric type.
  metric_type_prefix_include = [
    "monitoring.googleapis.com",
  ]
  ## Most metrics are updated no more than once per minute; it is recommended
  ## to override the agent level interval with a value of 1m or greater.
  interval = "1m"
# Send OpenTelemetry metrics over gRPC
[[outputs.opentelemetry]]
  ## Override the default (localhost:4317) OpenTelemetry gRPC service
  ## address:port
  service_address = "localhost:4317"
```

We are assuming that the OTel Collector is running on the same machine as Telegraf. If that is not the case, you will have to change the `service_address` in the `outputs.opentelemetry` section accordingly.

## Deploy OpenTelemetry to scrape the metrics from Telegraf
