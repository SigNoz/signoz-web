This document guides you on how to launch the Compute Engine instance on GCP.

### Launch Compute Engine

- On the GCP Console, search for `Compute Engine`, and navigate to the `Compute Engine` GCP service. Click on **CREATE INSTANCE** at the top.

- Select an appropriate machine configuration. Here, we have selected E2 machine.
- In the machine type, we have selected `e2-medium`. You can choose a larger machine in case you want to run multiple processes on this machine.

- Select the `Ubuntu` operating system, and the version as `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS x86/64, amd64 image`. You can put the disk size as per your requirement. We are going with `20GB` disk size for this example. Click on `Save`.
- In the `Identity and API Access` section, select the service account that has atleast `Pub/Sub Editor` permission.
- In the `Firewall` section, select `Allow HTTP access` and `Allow HTTPS access`.
- Click on **CREATE** button at the bottom, and wait for the instance to get created.
- Once the instance is created, click on the `SSH` button to connect to the instance. Click on the `Authorize` button on the popup. With this you will enter into the terminal of the instance.
