In this document, we will setup an application to be deployed and run on Google Cloud Run.

We will create a NodeJS frontend application and deploy it on GCP Cloud Run.

## Prerequisites

- A server running Ubuntu, along with a non-root user with sudo privileges.
- Docker installed on the server. You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker.
- Node.js and npm installed. You can follow the instructions on [Downloading and installing NodeJS and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install NodeJS and npm on your machine.
- A Docker Hub account.
- gcloud CLI installed on the server. You can follow the instructions on [this page](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#deb).
- Ensure `gcloud init` is performed.
- You will need Admin privileges for GCP Artifact Registry and GCP Cloud Run.

## Setup NodeJS Application

We will create a directory for the project in the non-root user’s home directory. We will name the project `cars_project`, but you should feel free to replace this with something else:

```bash
# Create the project directory
$ mkdir cars_project

# Enter into project directory
$ cd cars_project
```

This will be the root directory of the project.

Next, create a package.json file with your project’s dependencies and other identifying information. You can create this file using the command:

```bash
$ vi package.json
```

Put in appropriate information about the project in the `package.json` file. We will also include the required dependencies in the project.

```json
{
  "name": "cars_project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "NodeJS project on Cars",
  "author": "John Doe <john.doe@example.com>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "main": "app.js",
  "keywords": [
    "nodejs",
    "bootstrap",
    "express"
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.16.4"
  }
}
```

Save and close the file when you’ve finished making changes.

To install the project’s dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This will install the packages listed in the `package.json` file in the project directory.

## Create NodeJS Application

As mentioned in the `package.json` file, the entrypoint of the application is `app.js`. Create `app.js` file in the `cars_project` directory, and put in the following contents:

```nodejs
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const router = express.Router();

const path = __dirname + '/views/';
const port = 8080;
```

The `require` function loads the `express` module, which we then use to create the `app` and `router` objects. The `router` object will perform the routing function of the application, and as we define HTTP method routes we will add them to this object to define how our application will handle requests.

This section of the file also sets a couple of constants, `path` and `port`:

`path`: Defines the base directory, which will be the `views` subdirectory within the current project directory.
`port`: Tells the app to listen on and bind to port `8080`.

Next, in the same file, set the routes for the application using the `router` object:

```nodejs
router.use(function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('/' + req.method);
  next();
});

router.get('/', function(req, res){
  res.sendFile(path + 'index.html');
});

router.get('/cars', function(req, res){
  res.sendFile(path + 'cars.html');
});
```

The `router.use` function loads a [middleware function](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html) that will log the router’s requests and pass them on to the application’s routes. 
These are defined in the subsequent functions, which specify that a GET request to the base project URL should return the `index.html` page, while a GET request to the `/cars` route should return cars.html.

Finally, in the same file, mount the `router` middleware and the application’s static assets and tell the app to listen on port `8080`:

```nodejs
app.use(express.static(path));
app.use('/', router);

app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 8080!')
})
```

The finished `app.js` file will look like this:

```nodejs
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const router = express.Router();

const path = __dirname + '/views/';
const port = 8080;

router.use(function (req,res,next) {
  console.log('/' + req.method);
  next();
});

router.get('/', function(req,res){
  res.sendFile(path + 'index.html');
});

router.get('/cars', function(req,res){
  res.sendFile(path + 'cars.html');
});

app.use(express.static(path));
app.use('/', router);

app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 8080!')
})
```

Save and close the file when you are finished.

Next, let’s add some static content to the application. Start by creating the views directory:

```bash
$ mkdir views
```

Create the `index.html` file under the views directory using:

```bash
$ vi views/index.html
```

Add the following code to the `index.html` file, which will import Boostrap and create a `[jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/)` component with a link to the more detailed cars.html info page:

```

```

We have created a standard html page. We have also used stylesheet in the header `<link href="css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet">` which we will create later.

Save and close the file when you are finished.

With the application landing page in place, we can create our cars information page, `cars.html`, which will offer interested users more information about cars.

Open the file:

```bash
$ vi views/cars.html
```

Add the following code, which imports Bootstrap and the custom style sheet and offers users detailed information about certain cars:

</html>
```

Save and close the file when you are finished.

Finally, create the custom CSS style sheet that is linked to in `index.html` and `cars.html` by first creating a `css` folder in the `views` directory:

```bash
$ mkdir views/css
```

Open the style sheet:

```bash
$ vi views/css/styles.css
```

Add the following code, which will set the desired color and font for our pages:

```css
.navbar {
    margin-bottom: 0;
}

body {
    background: #020A1B;
    color: #ffffff;
    font-family: 'Merriweather', sans-serif;
}

h1,
h2 {
    font-weight: bold;
}

p {
    font-size: 16px;
    color: #ffffff;
}

.jumbotron {
    background: #a50c0c;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
}

.jumbotron p {
    color: white;
    font-size: 26px;
}

.btn-primary {
    color: #fff;
    text-color: #000000;
    border-color: white;
    background-color: #ea9999;
    margin-bottom: 5px;
}

img,
video,
audio {
    margin-top: 20px;
    max-width: 80%;
}

div.caption: {
    float: left;
    clear: both;
}
```

Save and close the file when you are finished.

To start the application, make sure that you are in your project’s root directory. Start the application with the command:

```bash
$ node app.js
```

In your browser, open the URL `http://localhost:8080`. The landing page of the application should get loaded.

## Writing the Dockerfile

Let us now create the Dockerfile which  specifies what will be included in the application container when it is executed. Using a Dockerfile allows you to define your container environment and avoid discrepancies with dependencies or runtime versions.

In the project’s root directory, create the `Dockerfile`:

```
$ vi Dockerfile
```

The contents of the `Dockerfile` will be:

```
FROM node:10-alpine

RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app/node_modules && chown -R node:node /home/node/app

WORKDIR /home/node/app

COPY package*.json ./

USER node

RUN npm install

COPY --chown=node:node . .

EXPOSE 8080

CMD [ "node", "app.js" ]
```

Save and close the file.

Here is what the Dockerfile contains:

- The `FROM` instruction is used to set the application's base image. The image used `node:10-alpine` includes Node.js and npm.
- Next, using `RUN` command, we run the instructions to create the `node_modules` directory, and apply appropriate ownership using `chown`.
- Then, we set the working directory as `/home/node/app`.
- We copy the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files to the working directory.
- To ensure that all of the application files are owned by the non-root `node` user, including the contents of the `node_modules` directory, switch the user to `node`.
- After copying the project dependencies and switching our user, we can run `npm install`.
- Copy the application code with the appropriate permissions to the application directory on the container.
- Expose port `8080` on the container and start the application using the command `node app.js`.

Before building the application image, let’s add a `.dockerignore` file. Working in a similar way to a `.gitignore` file, `.dockerignore` specifies which files and directories in your project directory should not be copied over to your container.

Open the `.dockerignore` file:

```bash
$ vi .dockerignore
```

Inside the file, add your local node modules, npm logs, Dockerfile, and `.dockerignore` file:

```
node_modules
npm-debug.log
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
```

Save and close the file when you are finished.

Let us now build the docker image using the command:

```bash
$ sudo docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t <your_dockerhub_username>/cars_project .
```

It will take a couple of minutes to build the image. Once it is complete, check the images using the command:

```bash
$ sudo docker images
```

You should be able to see your image `<your_dockerhub_username>/cars_project` in the list of images.

You can now run the application as a docker container using the command:

```bash
$ sudo docker run --name cars_project -p 80:8080 -d <your_dockerhub_username>/cars_project
```

Note that `-p` flag in the above command publishes the port on the container and maps it to a port on our host. We will use port 80 on the host, but you should feel free to modify this as necessary if you have another process running on that port.

Once the container is up and running, you can inspect a list of the running containers with:

```bash
$ sudo docker ps
```

You will receive the output containing all the running docker containers:

```
Output
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
20bff92d0ea7        <your_dockerhub_username>/cars_project               "node app.js"       8 seconds ago       Up 7 seconds        0.0.0.0:80->8080/tcp   cars_project
```

With the container running, you can now visit the application by navigating your browser to the server IP without the port: `http://localhost/`. You should see the application's landing page.

## Uploading the image to GCP Artifact Registry

### Setup GCP Artifact Registry

On the GCP console, search for `Artifact Registry`, and open the corresponding application. Enable the Artifact Registry if directed to the enabling `Artifact Registry API` page.

Click on **CREATE REPOSITORY** button at the top of the page to create a new repository.

<figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img

</figcaption>
</figure>

On the `Create repository` page, 

- Provide an appropriate name to the repository
- Select **Format** as `Docker`, and **Mode** as `Standard`.
- You can select the location type as per your requirement. Here, we will select `Region`, and choose an appropriate **Region** from the dropdown. Here, we have selected `us-central1`.
- You can optionally provide a description for the repository.
- All the remaining settings can be left as default.
- Click on **CREATE** button at the bottom of the page.

</i>
</figcaption>
</figure>

### Upload image to GCP Artifact Registry

From the terminal, run the command:

```
$ gcloud auth configure-docker <repository_region>-docker.pkg.dev

# With `us-central1` as the region, the command will be as follows
$ gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
```

Tag the docker image using the following command:

```bash
$ docker tag {local-image-name} <repository_region>-docker.pkg.dev/{project-name}/{repo-name}/{gcp-image-name}

# In this case, the command will be:
$ docker tag <your_dockerhub_username>/cars_project us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/omni-project/my-repository/cars_project
```

Then, push the image onto Artifact Registry.

```bash
$ docker push <repository_region>-docker.pkg.dev/{project-name}/{repo-name}/{gcp-image-name}

# In this case, the command will be:  
$ docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/omni-project/my-repository/cars_project
```

This command will take a couple of minutes. Once complete, you should be able to see the image on the repository's page.
