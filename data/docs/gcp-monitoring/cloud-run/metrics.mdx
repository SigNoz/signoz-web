## Overview

This documentation provides a detailed walkthrough on how to set up Cloud Run to send the metrics directly to SigNoz. By the end of this guide, you will have a setup that automatically sends your Cloud Run metrics to SigNoz.

<Tabs entityName="plans">
<TabItem value="cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>
**Here's a quick summary of what we will be doing in this guide**

* Create and configure Cloud Run
* Deploy OpenTelemetry Collector to fetch the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring
* Send and Visualize the metrics obtained by OpenTelemetry in SigNoz Cloud

## Prerequisites

* [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with administrative privilege or Cloud Run Admin and Compute Engine Admin privileges.
* [SigNoz Cloud Account](https://signoz.io/teams/) (we are using SigNoz Cloud for this demonstration, we will also need ingestion details. To get your **Ingestion Key** and **Ingestion URL,** sign-in to your SigNoz Cloud Account and go to **Settings** >> **Ingestion Settings**)
* Access to a project in GCP

## Setup

### Get started with Cloud Run service setup

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Cloud Run Service Setup](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/cloud-run/cloud-run-setup/) page to create Cloud Run Service.

## Deploy OpenTelemetry Collector to fetch the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring

You will need a Compute Engine instance to install OpenTelemetry Collector. You can follow the instructions on the [Creating Compute Engine](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation/) document to create the Compute Engine instance.

**Step 1:** Install and configure OpenTelemetry for scraping the metrics from Google Cloud Run. Follow [OpenTelemetry Binary Usage in Virtual Machine](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) guide for detailed instructions.

<Admonition type="note">
Note that `googlecloudmonitoring` receiver is supported only from version 0.112.0 and above of opentelemetry-collector. So, ensure you download and use the appropriate release.
</Admonition>

**Step 2:** Create `config.yaml`.

Under the `googlecloudmonitoring` receiver, you need to specify the metrics that you want to capture in the `metrics_list`. You can include all the metrics that you would like to capture from Cloud Run, see the [available metrics for Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-run).

Here is the `config.yaml` file for capturing Cloud Run metrics:

```
receivers:
  googlecloudmonitoring:
    collection_interval: 5m # Can be specified in seconds (s), minutes (m), or hours (h)
    project_id: gcp-project-id
    metrics_list:
      - metric_name: "run.googleapis.com/container/billable_instance_time"
      - metric_name: "run.googleapis.com/container/containers"
      - metric_name: "run.googleapis.com/request_count"
      - metric_name: "run.googleapis.com/request_latencies"
      - metric_name: "run.googleapis.com/container/network/received_bytes_count"
      - metric_name: "run.googleapis.com/container/network/sent_bytes_count"
processors:
  resource/env:
    attributes:
    - key: deployment.environment
      value: prod
      action: upsert
  batch: {}
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [googlecloudmonitoring]
      processors: [resource/env,batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the otlp endpoint will vary according to this table.

| Region	| Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| US | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

After successful configuration start the OpenTelemetry Collector using following command:

```sh
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

**Step 3:** If the configurations are configured correctly, you can see the output logs from OpenTelemtry as follows:

        alt="OTel Collector Logs"
    />

## Send and Visualize the metrics obtained by OpenTelemetry in SigNoz

**Step 1:** Go to the SigNoz Cloud URL and head over to the dashboard.

**Step 2:** If not already created, create a new dashboard. You can create the dashboard and multiple panel under it by following the instructions [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/).

**Step 3:** Select metric for Cloud Run

All metrics starting with `run_googleapis_com_` have been collected from Cloud Run.

For example `run_googleapis_com_request_count` is one of the metrics that was collected.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any problems while setting up monitoring for Cloud Run metrics with SigNoz, consider these troubleshooting steps:

* **Verify Configuration**: Double-check your `config.yaml` file to ensure all settings, including the ingestion key and endpoint, are correct.
* **Review Logs**: Look at the logs of the OpenTelemetry Collector to identify any error messages or warnings that might provide insights into whatâ€™s going wrong.
* **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all relevant packages and dependencies are up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.
* **Consult Documentation**: Review the SigNoz and OpenTelemetry documentation for any additional troubleshooting of the common issues.
