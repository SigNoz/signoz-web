## Overview

This document provides a detailed walkthrough on how to send Google Cloud Storage metrics to SigNoz. By the end of this guide, you will have a setup that sends your Cloud Storage metrics to SigNoz.

<Tabs entityName="plans">
<TabItem value="cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

**Here's a quick summary of what we will be doing in this guide**

* Create Cloud Storage bucket and objects
* Create and configure Compute Engine VM instance to deploy Telegraf and OpenTelemetry Collector
* Deploy OpenTelemetry Collector to scrape the metrics from Google Cloud monitoring
* Send and Visualize the metrics in SigNoz Cloud

## Prerequisites

* [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with administrative privilege or Compute Instance Admin privilege.
* [SigNoz Cloud Account](https://signoz.io/teams/) (we are using SigNoz Cloud for this demonstration, we will also need ingestion details. To get your **Ingestion Key** and **Ingestion URL,** sign-in to your SigNoz Cloud Account and go to **Settings** >> **Ingestion Settings**)
* Access to a project in GCP

## Setup

### Create Cloud Storage bucket and objects

Step 1: On the GCP console, search for Cloud Storage, go to **Cloud Storage** service.

Step 2: Click on the **CREATE** button at the top of the Cloud Storage page to create a bucket.

Step 3: On the **Create a Bucket** page, provide an appropriate name for the bucket in the **Name your bucket** section, and click on **CONTINUE**.

In the **Choose where to store your data section**, choose an appropriate location type, and click on **CONTINUE**. You can select an appropriate option in the rest of the sections as per your requirements, or let them be as default.

After filling the complete form, click on the **CREATE** button at the bottom of the page. This will create the new bucket.

Step 4: Optionally, you can also upload files to the newly created bucket. For that, click on the **UPLOAD FILES** button, and select the file you want to upload.

## Deploy OpenTelemetry to scrape the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring

**Step 1:** Install and configure OpenTelemetry for scraping the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring. Follow [OpenTelemetry Binary Usage in Virtual Machine](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) guide for detailed instructions.

<Admonition type="note">
Note that `googlecloudmonitoring` receiver is supported only from version 0.112.0 and above of opentelemetry-collector. So, ensure you download and use the appropriate release.
</Admonition>

**Step 2:** Create `config.yaml`.

Under the `googlecloudmonitoring` receiver, you need to specify the metrics that you want to capture in the `metrics_list`. You can include all the metrics that you would like to capture for Cloud Storage, see the [available metrics for Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-storage).

Here is the `config.yaml` file for capturing Cloud Storage metrics:

```
receivers:
  googlecloudmonitoring:
    collection_interval: 5m # Can be specified in seconds (s), minutes (m), or hours (h)
    project_id: my-project-id
    metrics_list:
      - metric_name: "storage.googleapis.com/api/request_count"
      - metric_name: "storage.googleapis.com/network/received_bytes_count"
      - metric_name: "storage.googleapis.com/network/sent_bytes_count"
      - metric_name: "storage.googleapis.com/storage/object_count"
      - metric_name: "storage.googleapis.com/storage/total_bytes"
      - metric_name: "storage.googleapis.com/storage/total_byte_seconds"
processors:
  resource/env:
    attributes:
    - key: deployment.environment
      value: prod
      action: upsert
  batch: {}
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [googlecloudmonitoring]
      processors: [resource/env,batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the otlp endpoint will vary according to this table.

| Region	| Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| US | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

After successful configuration start the OTel Collector using following command:

```sh
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

**Step 3:** If the configurations are configured correctly, you can see the output logs from OpenTelemtry as follows:

        alt="OTel Collector Logs"
    />

## Send and Visualize the metrics obtained by OpenTelemetry in SigNoz

**Step 1:** Go to the SigNoz Cloud URL and head over to the dashboard.

**Step 2:** If not already created, create a new dashboard. You can create the dashboard and multiple panel under it by following the instructions [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/).

**Step 3:** While creating the panel, select metric for Cloud Storage.

All metrics starting with `storage_googleapis_com_` have been collected from Cloud Storage instances.

For example, `storage_googleapis_com_storage_total_bytes` is one of the metrics which is collected.

Here is the sample dashboard for Cloud Storage:

    />

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any problems while setting up monitoring for your Cloud Storage metrics with SigNoz, consider these troubleshooting steps:

* **Verify Configuration**: Double-check your `config.yaml` file to ensure all settings, including the ingestion key and endpoint, are correct.
* **Review Logs**: Look at the logs of OpenTelemetry Collector to identify any error messages or warnings that might provide insights into what’s going wrong.
* **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all relevant packages and dependencies are up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.
* **Consult Documentation**: Review the SigNoz and OpenTelemetry documentation for any additional troubleshooting of the common issues.
