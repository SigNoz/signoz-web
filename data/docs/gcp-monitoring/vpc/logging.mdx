{/* **Here's a quick summary of what we will be doing in this guide**

* Create Serverless VPC Access Connector
* Enable Flow Logs
* Create Pub/Sub topic
* Create Log Router to route the Cloud Storage logs to SigNoz
* Create OTel Collector on Compute Engine instance to route logs from Pub/Sub topic to SigNoz Cloud
* Send and Visualize the logs in SigNoz Cloud */}

## Prerequisites

* [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with administrative privilege, or Serverless VPC Access Admin and Compute Engine Admin privilege. You might also require access to create Cloud Function in case you are following the tutorial to create Serverless VPC Connector.
* Access to a project in GCP

## Setup

### Create Serverless VPC Access Connector

Follow the [Creating Serverless VPC Access Connector](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/vpc/vpc-connector-creation/) document to create the serverless VPC access connector.

### Enable Flow Logs

Step 1: On the GCP Console, search for VPC, and select **VPC networks**.

Step 2: Enter the network where the traffic is being directed. In this case, the network on which the Compute Engine instance running the NodeJS is hosted.

    />

Step 3: Select the **Subnets** tab from the top, and enter into the subnet corresponding to the region whose flow logs you want to capture. In this case, it will be the region in which the Compute Engine instance running the NodeJS is hosted.

Step 4: Select **EDIT** on the top, and click on the `On` radio button under the **Flow logs**.

        alt="Turn on Flow Logs"
    />

Step 5: Click on **SAVE**. The flow logs are now enabled for the network in the corresponding region.

### Create PubSub Topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Pub/Sub Topic](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/pubsub-topic-creation/) document to create the Pub/Sub topic.

### Create Log Router to Pub/Sub Topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Log Router Setup](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/log-router-setup/) document to create the Log Router.

To ensure you filter out only the Compute Engine logs, use the following filter conditions:

```
resource.type="gce_subnetwork"
```

### Setup OTel Collector

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Compute Engine](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation/) document to create another Compute Engine instance. We will be installing OTel Collector on this instance.

#### Install OTel Collector as agent

Firstly, we will establish the authentication using the following commands:

1. Initialize `gcloud`:

```
gcloud init
```

2. Authenticate into GCP:

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Let us now proceed to the OTel Collector installation:

Step 1: Download otel-collector tar.gz for your architecture

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.88.0/otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

Step 2: Extract otel-collector tar.gz to the otelcol-contrib folder

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```

Step 3: Create `config.yaml` in the folder `otelcol-contrib` with the below content in it. Replace `<region>` with the appropriate SigNoz Cloud region. Replace `SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY` with what is provided by SigNoz:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  googlecloudpubsub:
    project: <gcp-project-id>
    subscription: projects/<gcp-project-id>/subscriptions/<pubsub-topic's-subscription>
    encoding: raw_text
processors:
  batch: {}
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<SigNoz-Key>"
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, googlecloudpubsub]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Step 4: Once we are done with the above configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command:

From the otelcol-contrib, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

**Run in background**

If you want to run OTel Collector process in the background:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

The above command sends the output of the otel-collector to `otelcol-output.log` file and prints the process id of the background running OTel Collector process to the `otel-pid` file.

If you want to see the output of the logs you’ve just set up for the background process, you may look it up with:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```

### Visualize the Logs obtained by OpenTelemetry in SigNoz Cloud

You can now visualize the logs corresponding to the traffic being sent on this VPC network.

### Create PubSub Topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Pub/Sub Topic](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/pubsub-topic-creation/) document to create the Pub/Sub topic.

### Create Log Router to Pub/Sub Topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Log Router Setup](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/log-router-setup/) document to create the Log Router.

To ensure you filter out only the Compute Engine logs, use the following filter conditions:

```
resource.type="gce_subnetwork"
```

### Setup OTel Collector

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Compute Engine](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation/) document to create the Compute Engine instance. 

#### Install OTel Collector as agent

Firstly, we will establish the authentication using the following commands:

Step 2: Extract otel-collector tar.gz to the otelcol-contrib folder

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```

Step 3: Create `config.yaml` in the folder `otelcol-contrib` with the below content in it. We are using the `clickhouselogsexporter` in this case.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  googlecloudpubsub:
    project: <gcp-project-id>
    subscription: projects/<gcp-project-id>/subscriptions/<pubsub-topic's-subscription>
    encoding: raw_text
processors:
  batch: {}
exporters:
  clickhouselogsexporter:
    dsn: tcp://clickhouse:9000/
    timeout: 5s
    sending_queue:
      queue_size: 100
    retry_on_failure:
      enabled: true
      initial_interval: 5s
      max_interval: 30s
      max_elapsed_time: 300s
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, googlecloudpubsub]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [clickhouselogsexporter]
```

Step 4: Once we are done with the above configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command:

From the otelcol-contrib, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

**Run in background**

If you want to run OTel Collector process in the background:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

The above command sends the output of the otel-collector to `otelcol-output.log` file and prints the process id of the background running OTel Collector process to the `otel-pid` file.

If you want to see the output of the logs you’ve just set up for the background process, you may look it up with:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```

### Visualize the Logs obtained by OpenTelemetry in SigNoz

You can now visualize the logs corresponding to the traffic being sent on this VPC network.
