<TabItem value="cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>
**Here's a quick summary of what we will be doing in this guide**

* Create and configure Compute Engine
* Create Pub/Sub topic
* Create Log Router to route the Compute Engine logs to SigNoz
* Create Compute Engine instance
* Create OTel Collector to route logs from Pub/Sub topic to SigNoz Cloud
* Make changes to Compute Engine instance to generate logs
* Send and Visualize the logs in SigNoz Cloud

## Prerequisites

* [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with administrative privilege or Compute Instance Admin privilege.
* [SigNoz Cloud Account](https://signoz.io/teams/) (we are using SigNoz Cloud for this demonstration, we will also need ingestion details. To get your **Ingestion Key** and **Ingestion URL,** sign-in to your SigNoz Cloud Account and go to **Settings** >> **Ingestion Settings**)
* Access to a project in GCP

### Get started with Compute Engine Configuration

Create the Compute Engine instance using the following steps:

Step 1: Go to your GCP console and search for Compute Engine, go to **Compute Engine** service and click on **CREATE INSTANCE**.

        alt="Compute Engine Instance Settings"
    />
<figcaption>

</figure>

With this, the Compute Engine instance is created.

### Create PubSub Topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Pub/Sub Topic](/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/pubsub-topic-creation) document to create the Pub/Sub topic.

### Create Log Router to Pub/Sub Topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Log Router Setup](/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/log-router-setup) document to create the Log Router.

To ensure you filter out only the Compute Engine logs, use the following filter conditions:

```
resource.type="gce_instance"
```

### Setup OTel Collector

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Compute Engine](/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation) document to create another Compute Engine instance. We will be installing OTel Collector on this instance.

#### Install OTel Collector as agent

Firstly, we will establish the authentication using the following commands:

1. Initialize `gcloud`:

```
gcloud init
```

2. Authenticate into GCP:

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Let us now proceed to the OTel Collector installation:

Step 1: Download otel-collector tar.gz for your architecture

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.88.0/otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

Step 2: Extract otel-collector tar.gz to the otelcol-contrib folder

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```

Step 3: Create `config.yaml` in the folder `otelcol-contrib` with the below content in it. Replace `<region>` with the appropriate SigNoz Cloud region. Replace `SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY` with what is provided by SigNoz:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  googlecloudpubsub:
    project: <gcp-project-id>
    subscription: projects/<gcp-project-id>/subscriptions/<pubsub-topic's-subscription>
    encoding: raw_text
processors:
  batch: {}
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-access-token": "<SigNoz-Key>"
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, googlecloudpubsub]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Step 4: Once we are done with the above configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command:

From the otelcol-contrib, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

**Run in background**

If you want to run OTel Collector process in the background:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

The above command sends the output of the otel-collector to `otelcol-output.log` file and prints the process id of the background running OTel Collector process to the `otel-pid` file.

If you want to see the output of the logs youâ€™ve just set up for the background process, you may look it up with:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```

### Invoking Compute Engine logs

Step 1: Go to the Compute Engine homepage, and click on the instance created at the beginning of this guide.

Step 2: Click on the **EDIT** button at the top of the Compute Engine instance's page.

</figcaption>
</figure>

Step 4: Give an appropriate name and description for the additional disk. You can reduce the size to `10`. Click on **SAVE** button at the bottom.

Step 5: Click on **SAVE** button for the Compute Engine instance.

This will generate the Compute Engine logs which you can now see on the SigNoz Cloud.

</figcaption>
</figure>

With this, the Compute Engine instance is created.

### Create PubSub Topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Pub/Sub Topic](/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/pubsub-topic-creation) document to create the Pub/Sub topic.

### Create Log Router to Pub/Sub Topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Log Router Setup](/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/log-router-setup) document to create the Log Router.

To ensure you filter out only the Compute Engine logs, use the following filter conditions:

```
resource.type="gce_instance"
```

### Setup OTel Collector

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Compute Engine](/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation) document to create the Compute Engine instance. 

#### Install OTel Collector as agent

Firstly, we will establish the authentication using the following commands:

1. Initialize `gcloud`:

```
gcloud init
```

2. Authenticate into GCP:

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Let us now proceed to the OTel Collector installation:

Step 1: Download otel-collector tar.gz for your architecture

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.88.0/otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

Step 2: Extract otel-collector tar.gz to the otelcol-contrib folder

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```

Step 3: Create `config.yaml` in the folder `otelcol-contrib` with the below content in it. We are using the `clickhouselogsexporter` in this case.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  googlecloudpubsub:
    project: <gcp-project-id>
    subscription: projects/<gcp-project-id>/subscriptions/<pubsub-topic's-subscription>
    encoding: raw_text
processors:
  batch: {}
exporters:
  clickhouselogsexporter:
    dsn: tcp://clickhouse:9000/
    timeout: 5s
    sending_queue:
      queue_size: 100
    retry_on_failure:
      enabled: true
      initial_interval: 5s
      max_interval: 30s
      max_elapsed_time: 300s
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, googlecloudpubsub]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [clickhouselogsexporter]
```

Step 4: Once we are done with the above configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command:

From the otelcol-contrib, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

**Run in background**

If you want to run OTel Collector process in the background:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

The above command sends the output of the otel-collector to `otelcol-output.log` file and prints the process id of the background running OTel Collector process to the `otel-pid` file.

If you want to see the output of the logs youâ€™ve just set up for the background process, you may look it up with:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```
