## Overview

This documentation provides a detailed walkthrough on how to set up Google App Engine to send the traces directly to SigNoz. By the end of this guide, you will have a setup that automatically sends your App Engine traces to SigNoz.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>
**Here's a quick summary of what we will be doing in this guide**

* Create and configure App Engine
* Invoke the deployed App Engine service to generate traces
* Send and Visualize the traces in SigNoz Cloud

## Prerequisites

* [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with administrative privilege or App Engine Admin privilege.
* [SigNoz Cloud Account](https://signoz.io/teams/) (we are using SigNoz Cloud for this demonstration, we will also need ingestion details. To get your **Ingestion Key** and **Ingestion URL,** sign-in to your SigNoz Cloud Account and go to **Settings** >> **Ingestion Settings**)
* Access to a project in GCP
* [Cloud Build API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudbuild.googleapis.com) is enabled

### Get started with App Engine Configuration

Create the App Engine service using the following steps:

Step 1: [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI.

Step 2: To [initialize](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command:

```
gcloud init
```

Step 3: Run the following `gcloud` command to enable App Engine and create the associated application resources. Note that the [location](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/building-app/creating-gcp-project#creating_a_gcp_project) you select cannot be changed later.

```
gcloud app create
```

Step 4: In this example, we will be building the NodeJS application. For this,

1. Create a folder for your NodeJS service, say `my-nodejs-service`, and navigate to that folder in your terminal. Create the NodeJS project in this folder using the command `npm init`.

2. Install the requried dependencies, express and opentelemetry dependencies, using the following commands

```
npm install --save express
npm install --save @opentelemetry/api@^1.7.0
npm install --save @opentelemetry/sdk-node@^0.45.1
npm install --save @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node@^0.39.4
npm install --save @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http@^0.45.1
```

Note that this step is only required in case you want to try running the application locally.

3. In the service folder, create `server.js` file with the following contents:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from App Engine!');
});

// Listen to the App Engine-specified port, or 8080 otherwise
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}...`);
});
```

This file contains the actual application logic. Here, we have created a very simple application that opens a GET endpoint at `/` which sends out a statement "Hello from App Engine!" in the response.

4. Next, let us create another file `tracing.js` that contains the instrumentation code to send out traces to SigNoz.

You need to configure the endpoint for SigNoz Cloud in this file. You can find your ingestion key from SigNoz Cloud account details sent on your email.

```
// tracing.js
'use strict'

const process = require('process')
const opentelemetry = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-node')
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node')
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http')
const { Resource } = require('@opentelemetry/resources')
const { SemanticResourceAttributes } = require('@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions')

// do not set headers in exporterOptions, the OTel spec recommends setting headers through ENV variables
// https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md#specifying-headers-via-environment-variables

// highlight-start
const exporterOptions = {
  url: 'https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443/v1/traces',
}
// highlight-end

const traceExporter = new OTLPTraceExporter(exporterOptions)
const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  traceExporter,
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
  resource: new Resource({
    // highlight-next-line
    [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME]: 'appengine_nodejs_app',
  }),
})

// initialize the SDK and register with the OpenTelemetry API
// this enables the API to record telemetry
sdk.start()

// gracefully shut down the SDK on process exit
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  sdk
    .shutdown()
    .then(() => console.log('Tracing terminated'))
    .catch((error) => console.log('Error terminating tracing', error))
    .finally(() => process.exit(0))
})
```

In this example, we have used `appengine_nodejs_app` as the service name. You can feel free to change it appropriately as per your use-case.

Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the ingest endpoint will vary according to this table.

| Region | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| US |	ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN |	ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

5. Modify the `package.json` file with the following contents in the `scripts` and `dependencies` section.

```json
{
  "name": "my-nodejs-service",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node -r ./tracing.js server.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": "",
  "dependencies": {
    "@opentelemetry/api": "^1.7.0",
    "@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node": "^0.39.4",
    "@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http": "^0.45.1",
    "@opentelemetry/sdk-node": "^0.45.1",
    "express": "^4.19.2"
  }
}
```

With these changes, the start script for the application is `node -r ./tracing.js server.js`, and all the dependencies are now part of `package.json`. You can optionally try to run the script locally using the command `node server.js` to check if the application is running as expected.

6. Create the `app.yaml` file with the following contents:

```yaml
runtime: nodejs20

env_variables:
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: "signoz-access-token=<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
```

Put the appropriate `SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY`. It is the API token provided by SigNoz. You can find your ingestion key from SigNoz cloud account details sent on your email.

With this the NodeJS application is ready to be deployed to App Engine.

Step 5: When on this folder which contains `app.yaml`, you can deploy your service using the command:

```
gcloud app deploy
```

Step 6: On running the above command, the service will get deployed on the App Engine, and you will get the logs containing the endpoint which can be used to trigger the deployed service (highlighted in red in the screenshot).

    />
<figcaption>

</figure>

Open the URL in the new browser which will invoke the service. You will receive "Hello from App Engine!" as the response in your browser.

The opening of the URL in the browser has triggered the App Engine service, and it will result in the traces which would now also start appearing in the SigNoz Cloud as we have instrumented the tracing.

```
gcloud app create
```

Step 4: In this example, we will be building the NodeJS application. For this,

1. Create a folder for your NodeJS service, say `my-nodejs-service`, and navigate to that folder in your terminal. Create the NodeJS project in this folder using the command `npm init`.

2. Install the requried dependencies, express and opentelemetry dependencies, using the following commands

```
npm install --save express
npm install --save @opentelemetry/api@^1.7.0
npm install --save @opentelemetry/sdk-node@^0.45.1
npm install --save @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node@^0.39.4
npm install --save @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http@^0.45.1
```

Note that this step is only required in case you want to try running the application locally.

3. In the service folder, create `server.js` file with the following contents:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from App Engine!');
});

// Listen to the App Engine-specified port, or 8080 otherwise
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}...`);
});
```

This file contains the actual application logic. Here, we have created a very simple application that opens a GET endpoint at `/` which sends out a statement "Hello from App Engine!" in the response.

4. Next, let us create another file `tracing.js` that contains the instrumentation code to send out traces to SigNoz.

You need to configure the endpoint for SigNoz Cloud in this file. You can find your ingestion key from SigNoz Cloud account details sent on your email.

```
// tracing.js
'use strict'

const process = require('process')
const opentelemetry = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-node')
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node')
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http')
const { Resource } = require('@opentelemetry/resources')
const { SemanticResourceAttributes } = require('@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions')

// do not set headers in exporterOptions, the OTel spec recommends setting headers through ENV variables
// https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md#specifying-headers-via-environment-variables

// highlight-start
const exporterOptions = {
  url: 'http://localhost:4318/v1/traces',
}
// highlight-end

const traceExporter = new OTLPTraceExporter(exporterOptions)
const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  traceExporter,
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
  resource: new Resource({
    // highlight-next-line
    [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME]: 'appengine_nodejs_app',
  }),
})

// initialize the SDK and register with the OpenTelemetry API
// this enables the API to record telemetry
sdk.start()

// gracefully shut down the SDK on process exit
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  sdk
    .shutdown()
    .then(() => console.log('Tracing terminated'))
    .catch((error) => console.log('Error terminating tracing', error))
    .finally(() => process.exit(0))
})
```

In this example, we have used `appengine_nodejs_app` as the service name. You can feel free to change it appropriately as per your use-case.

`http://localhost:4318/v1/traces` is the default url for sending your tracing data. We are assuming you have installed SigNoz on your `localhost`. Based on your environment, you can update it accordingly. It should be in the following format:

```
http://<IP of SigNoz backend>:4318/v1/traces
```

5. Modify the `package.json` file with the following contents in the `scripts` and `dependencies` section.

```json
{
  "name": "my-nodejs-service",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node -r ./tracing.js server.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": "",
  "dependencies": {
    "@opentelemetry/api": "^1.7.0",
    "@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node": "^0.39.4",
    "@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http": "^0.45.1",
    "@opentelemetry/sdk-node": "^0.45.1",
    "express": "^4.19.2"
  }
}
```

With these changes, the start script for the application is `node -r ./tracing.js server.js`, and all the dependencies are now part of `package.json`. You can optionally try to run the script locally using the command `node server.js` to check if the application is running as expected.

6. Create the `app.yaml` file with the following contents:

```yaml
runtime: nodejs20
```

With this the NodeJS application is ready to be deployed to App Engine.

Step 5: When on this folder which contains `app.yaml`, you can deploy your service using the command:

```
gcloud app deploy
```

Step 6: On running the above command, the service will get deployed on the App Engine, and you will get the logs containing the endpoint which can be used to trigger the deployed service (highlighted in red in the screenshot).

Open the URL in the new browser which will invoke the service. You will receive "Hello from App Engine!" as the response in your browser.

The opening of the URL in the browser has triggered the App Engine service, and it will result in the traces which would now also start appearing in SigNoz as we have instrumented the tracing.
