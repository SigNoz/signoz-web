Frontend monitoring helps you understand how users experience your application in real-world conditions. It enables you to track performance issues, capture user behavior, and detect errors in production.

SigNoz uses OpenTelemetry to collect key performance metrics, capture JavaScript errors, trace requests from the browser to the backend, and monitor network activity, all within a unified platform. This provides end-to-end visibility into your frontend stack, helping developers and SREs troubleshoot faster and improve user experience.

Frontend monitoring focuses on 3 core aspects:

### 1. Performance Monitoring
  Monitoring performance is essential to delivering a fast, responsive user experience. Slow-loading websites often result in higher bounce rates, lower user engagement, and decreased conversions.
  By actively collecting performance metrics, you can identify frontend bottlenecks, optimize critical rendering paths, and make data-driven improvements. 
  This leads to a more seamless experience for users and directly contributes to improved business outcomes.

  - [Capturing Web Vitals](/docs/frontend-monitoring/opentelemetry-web-vitals) - Track the health and responsiveness of your application with performance-focused signals recommended by Google.
  - Sending Custom Metrics - Instrument your application to send custom business or performance metrics to evaluate critical UI flows and components.
  - [Document Load Times](/docs/frontend-monitoring/document-load) - Collect performance metrics related to the loading of HTML documents.

### 2. Behavioural Monitoring
  Understanding how users interact with your application is crucial for optimizing user experience, improving engagement, and driving business goals. 
  Behavior monitoring tracks user actions, navigation patterns, and engagement metrics to provide insights into how your application is actually being used.

  - [Sending Log Analytics](/docs/frontend-monitoring/sending-logs) - Collect and send client-side logs to SigNoz for events, errors, warnings, and state changes.
  - [Distributed Tracing](/docs/frontend-monitoring/sending-traces) - Propagate the context of your traces from frontend to backend for a complete view of user journeys.
  - [Network Calls Monitoring](/docs/frontend-monitoring/sending-traces) - Capture metadata of all outgoing HTTP requests within your application.
  - Real User Monitoring -  Measure and analyse how actual users experience your application in production. A unified experience formed by integrating all the components listed above

### 3. Error Monitoring
  Error monitoring is a critical aspect of frontend monitoring that helps identify issues users encounter while interacting with your application. 
  By tracking and analyzing these errors, you can proactively fix bugs before they affect more users, improving both user experience and application reliability.

  - Capture JavaScript errors, warnings, exceptions and console errors within your application.
  - Real User Monitoring - Correlate errors with real-world user sessions to better understand their impact.
