Want to explore SigNoz without setting up your own app? This quickstart guide walks you on how to spin up the [OpenTelemetry Demo Application](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo) and 
start sending logs, metrics, and traces to SigNoz Cloud in minutes.

The OpenTelemetry Demo App is a distributed application with built-in telemetry and simulated failure scenarios. This makes it an ideal environment for testing observability workflows with SigNoz.

## Prerequisites

- [A SigNoz Cloud account](/teams/)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the OpenTelemetry Demo App

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo.git
cd opentelemetry-demo
```

### Step 2: Configure the Collector to Send Data to SigNoz

Edit the file `src/otel-collector/otelcol-config-extras.yml` and add the following exporter configuration:

```yml:otelcol-config-extras.yml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      signoz-ingestion-key: <your-ingestion-key>
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      exporters: [otlp]
    traces:
      exporters: [spanmetrics, otlp]
    logs: 
      exporters: [otlp]
```

- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#get-started)


<Admonition>
When merging this configuration with `otelcol-config.yml`, be aware that array values like `exporters` replace existing values. Always ensure `spanmetrics` is included in the trace pipeline to avoid 
runtime errors.
</Admonition>

### Step 3: Start the Demo App

From the root of the `opentelemetry-demo` directory, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Verify the services are running:

```bash
docker compose ps -a
```

</figure>

If you're running the app in your local machine, visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to interact with the application.

### Step 4: Verify Telemetry in SigNoz Cloud

1. Navigate to the **Services** tab â€” you should see a list of services from the demo app
2. Use the **Service Map** to visualize the architecture and request flows
3. Check the **Traces**, **Logs**, and **Metrics** tabs to explore telemetry data

You are now successfully sending data to SigNoz Cloud!


## Next Steps

To simulate real-world debugging scenarios and test observability features:

- Visit `http://localhost:8080/feature`
- Enable flags to simulate failures (e.g., `KafkaQueueProblems`, `cartFailure`, `productCatalogFailure`)
- **Import** our custom dashboards:
  - [Kafka Metrics Dashboard JSON](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz-web/tree/main/public/dashboards/otel-demo-kafka-metrics.json)
  - [Span Metrics Dashboard JSON](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz-web/tree/main/public/dashboards/otel-demo-span-metrics.json)
