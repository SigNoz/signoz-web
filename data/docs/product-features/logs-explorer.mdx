## Introduction

The Logs Explorer page in SigNoz enables developers to filter, examine, and analyze logs. There are two ways to filter the logs and each way has 3 different views available in Logs Explorer which include:

- [List View](#list-view)
- [Time Series View](#time-series-view)
- [Table View](#table-view)


## Operations on Data

### Search

The search feature in Logs Explorer allows you to filter your logs data using different attributes (like `serviceName`, `status` etc.) using operators (like `IN`, `=` etc.). You can filter using multiple attributes simultaneously.

<br></br>

### Query Builder

Just like search, the Query Builder also allows you to filter your logs data based on different attributes using operators. The Query Builder provides you with additional powerful features like aggregation, grouping etc. on your data. To learn more about the Query Builder, refer to this [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/).

## Views

There are three views available in both Search and Query Builder.

### List View

The list view in logs explorer has the following features:

**Download logs**

You can download your logs in two format:
- Excel (.xlsx)
- CSV

#### Settings

The settings option has three sections:

**Format**

There are three formats available which represents the logs in different formats :
1. **Raw**: Shows the logs entries in the raw format as they appear in the logging system.
2. **Default**: It provides a balanced view by formatting a raw log based on different attributes to make it more readable.
3. **Column**: It organizes the logs data into different attribute Columns to provide a tabular view of logs.

    <figcaption><i>Different logs format </i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br></br>

**Max lines per row**

The maximum number of lines of text that each log entry is allowed to display.

    <figcaption><i>Maximum lines per log rows </i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br></br>

**Columns**

You can add new columns for the different attributes available in your logs. This only works for **Default** and **Column** format. By default the log is formatted into `Timestamp` and `Body` in the Default and Column views.

</figure>
<br></br>

**Show in Context**

When you hover over a log in any format, at the right most side, you'll find an option to `Show in Context`.

This will by default show you 10 logs before and 10 logs after the log that you have selected which can be used in faster debugging.

You can load more than 10 logs logs and also filter the logs by a particular attribute.

</figure>
<br></br>

**Copy Link**

You can copy the link to a particular log line which can be shared and accessed by anyone who has access to same SigNoz instance.

### Time Series View

The Time Series View provides a graphical representation of logs data over time based on the filters or operations applied.

    <figcaption><i> Timeseries View in Logs Explorer </i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br></br>


### Table View

The Table View provides a tabular representation of different operations like the count logs, average of duration etc., based on the filters applied.

    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/logs-explorer/logs-explorer-table-view.webp" alt="Table View in the Logs Explorer"/>
    <figcaption><i> Table View in Logs Explorer </i></figcaption>

<br></br>


## Log Details

When you click on a log line in any format it will open up a Log Detail panel which gives a comprehensive view of your log. This is only available in the List View.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/logs-explorer/logs-explorer-log-details.webp" alt="Log Details Panel in Logs Explorer"/>
    <figcaption><i>Log Details Panel in Logs Explorer </i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br></br>

The panel provides the following sections:

### Overview

Overview has two sections:

**Body**

This shows the complete body of the log in `JSON` format by default. Once you toggle on `Wrap text`, the logs get converted to the Raw format.

</figure>
<br></br>

**Attributes**

This the attributes of the logs in a tabular format showing the attribute name and its value.

The following features are available in this section:

**Pin an attribute**

You can pin an attribute using the pin icon shown on the left side of the attribute name. The pinned attribute will be shown at the top when you open a new log line.

    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/logs-explorer/logs-explorer-log-details-overview-2.gif" alt="Pin an attribute"/>
    <figcaption><i> Pin an attribute </i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br></br>

**Search Attribute**

You can search for an attribute available in your log using the search bar.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/logs-explorer/logs-explorer-log-details-overview-3.gif" alt="Search an attribute"/>
    <figcaption><i> Pin an attribute </i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br></br>

**Filter for Value**

Using this, you can instantly filter the logs based on a particular attribute and its value using the IN operator.

For example, if the attribute is `container_id` and it's value is `debian` then using Filter for Value will create a filter `container_id IN debian`. This will list the logs where the `container_id` attribute is `debian`.

    <figcaption><i> Filter for Value </i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br></br>


**Filter out Value**

Using this, you can instantly filter the logs based on a particular attribute and its value using the NOT_IN operator.

For example, if the attribute is `container_id` and it's value is `debian` then using Filter out Value will create a filter `container_id NOT_IN debian`. This will list the logs where the `container_id` attribute is not `debian`.

### JSON

This section displays the log in JSON format. You can:

**Wrap Text**

Switching the toggle on for wrap text will convert your log to raw format from JSON.

    <figcaption><i> Wrap text </i></figcaption>

<br></br>

**Copy Log**

Copy your log in either JSON or Raw form.

    <figcaption><i> Copy Log </i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br></br>


### Context

This section will by default show you 10 logs before and 10 logs after the log that you have selected which can be used in faster debugging.

You can:
- Load more than 10 logs.
- Filter the logs by a particular attribute.

<br></br>

## Live View

The Live View streams new log entries continuously as they occur. This can help in debugging the real-time incidents.

    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/logs-explorer/logs-explorer-live-view.gif" alt="Switch to Live view in Logs Explorer"/>
    <figcaption><i>Switch to Live view in Logs Explorer</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br></br>

These are the following features available in live view:

**Search Filter**

You can filter your logs based on different attributes. Just below the search filter section, you get a histogram which shows the count of logs at different times for the particular filter(s).

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/logs-explorer/logs-explorer-live-view-1.gif" alt="Search filter in Live view"/>
    <figcaption><i>Search filter in Live view</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br></br>

**Format**

Just like [List View](#list-view), there are three formats in which you can view your logs:
- Raw
- Table
- List (Default)

By hovering over the `Format` button in the Raw and Table View, you can change the `Max lines per Row` for your logs.

    <figcaption><i>Different formats in Live view</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br></br>

**Pause and Resume**

The Live Logs can be paused to stop the real-time feed. This allows users to scroll through the logs without new entries being pushed.
