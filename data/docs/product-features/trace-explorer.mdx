## Introduction

The Traces Explorer page in SigNoz enables developers to filter, examine, and analyze traces. There are four different views available in Traces Explorer which include:

- [List View](#list-view)
- [Trace View](#traces-view)
- [Time Series View](#time-series-view)
- [Table View](#table-view)

### List View

The List View is the default view on the Traces Explorer page.

    <figcaption><i> List View in Trace Explorer </i></figcaption>
</figure>


You can perform the following operations in List view:

**Apply Filters**

- **Filtering** - Narrow down the trace data based on specific filters such as `responseStatusCode` .

- **Order By** - Use `Order By` to filter the data in a particular order.

    <figcaption><i> Filter and Order By in List View in Trace Explorer </i></figcaption>
</figure>


<Admonition>
- The **Group By**, **Add a query** and **Add a function** features are not supported in List View. 
</Admonition>

**Customize Columns**

Add or delete columns using the `Options` button. For example, you can add the `httpMethod` column to see the request methods alongside each trace.

<Admonition>
- Timestamp column can't be removed.

**Number of Spans to display**

You can increase the number of spans displayed upto 200/page using the dropdown shown in image below.

### Traces View

The Traces View focuses on analysis of traces related to root span. A root span also know as a Parent span is the starting point of a trace.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/trace-explorer/trace-explorer-traces-view.webp" alt="Traces View in the Trace Explorer"/>
    <figcaption><i> Traces View in Trace Explorer </i></figcaption>
</figure>


You can perform the following operations in Traces view:

**Apply Filters**

Filters applied in this view will only be applied on the root spans, not the entire traces.

For example,

When you apply filters for `serviceName` or `durationNano`(For the Root span duration) these will be applied on the Root Span only.

</figure>


<Admonition>
- The **Group By**, **Add a query** and **Add a function** features are not supported in List View. 
- Right now there is no support to filter by `No. of Spans`
</Admonition>

**Root Duration**

Traces are sorted by descending order of duration which helps in identifying the longest running trace.

**Number of Traces to display**

You can increase the number of spans upto 200/page using the dropdown shown in image below.

</figure>


### Time Series View

The Time Series View provides a graphical representation of trace data over time.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/trace-explorer/trace-explorer-timeseries-view.webp" alt="Timeseries View in the Trace Explorer"/>
    <figcaption><i> Timeseries View in Trace Explorer </i></figcaption>
</figure>


The Time Series View has the following components:

**Query Builder**

Query builder helps in filtering, aggregation and grouping of your traces data. Refer to this [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/) to read more about the capabilities of the Query Builder.

    <figcaption><i> Query Builder in Timeseries View </i></figcaption>
</figure>


**Graph View**

This provides you with a graphical representation of the output of Query made using the Query Builder.

</figure>


### Table View

The Table View provides a tabular representation of the trace data.

    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/trace-explorer/trace-explorer-table-view.webp" alt="Table View in the Trace Explorer"/>
    <figcaption><i> Table View in Trace Explorer </i></figcaption>
</figure>



**Query Builder**

Just like Time Series View, the Query builder in Table view also helps in filtering, aggregation and grouping of your traces data. Refer to this [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/) to read more about the capabilities of the Query Builder.

**Table**

This provides you with a tabular representation of the output of Query made using the Query Builder.

## Quick Filters

The Traces Explorer in SigNoz provides a feature for quick filtering of spans using various parameters. 
This functionality allows users to quickly search their specific spans, making it easier to analyze and debug applications. 
Here's a detailed explanation of the available filters and how to use them.

</figure>

### Available Filters

1. **Duration**:
   - **Description**: Filter spans based on their duration.
   - **Usage**: Specify a minimum and maximum duration in milliseconds to find spans that fall within this time range. This is useful for identifying spans that are unusually long or short.
   
2. **Status**:
   - **Description**: Filter spans by their status.
   - **Usage**: Options can include `Error` and `Ok`. Use this filter to quickly identify spans that resulted in errors or were successful.

3. **Service Name**:
   - **Description**: Filter spans by the name of the service that generated them.
   - **Usage**: Select from a list of service names to isolate spans from a specific service. This can be helpful in microservices architectures where multiple services generate spans.

4. **Operation / Name**:
   - **Description**: Filter spans based on the operation or name.
   - **Usage**: Select specific operations, such as HTTP GET requests or SQL SELECT queries, to focus on particular types of operations within your spans.

5. **RPC Method**:
   - **Description**: Filter spans by the RPC method used.
   - **Usage**: Useful for isolating spans based on the remote procedure call methods.

6. **Status Code**:
   - **Description**: Filter spans by their HTTP status code.
   - **Usage**: Select from common status codes like `200`, `404`, `500`, etc., to find spans that resulted in specific HTTP responses.

7. **HTTP Host**:
   - **Description**: Filter spans by the HTTP host.
   - **Usage**: Specify the host to find spans related to particular HTTP hosts.

8. **HTTP Method**:
   - **Description**: Filter spans by the HTTP method.
   - **Usage**: Choose HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, etc., to filter spans based on the type of HTTP request.

9. **HTTP Route**:
   - **Description**: Filter spans by the HTTP route.
   - **Usage**: Specify routes to find spans related to specific paths in your application.

10. **HTTP URL**:
    - **Description**: Filter spans by the full HTTP URL.
    - **Usage**: Useful for isolating spans related to specific URLs, providing a more granular filter compared to HTTP routes.

11. **Trace ID**:
    - **Description**: Filter spans by their unique Trace ID.
    - **Usage**: Enter a specific Trace ID to find and analyze an individual trace. This is particularly useful for deep dives into specific transactions.

### How to Use Quick Filters

1. **Accessing Filters**: Open the Traces Explorer and locate the Filters panel on the left side.
2. **Selecting Filters**: Click on the desired filter category to expand it. For example, click on "Duration" to set a time range.
3. **Setting Filter Values**: Enter or select the appropriate values for the filter. For instance, you can specify a minimum and maximum duration or select specific status codes.
4. **Applying Filters**: Once you set the filter values, the Traces Explorer will automatically update the displayed spans based on the selected filters.
5. **Clearing Filters**: If you need to reset a filter, click on the "Clear All" option next to the filter category. You can also clear all applied filters at once by clicking on a Reset button available at the top.


## Bottom Bar
The bar present at the Bottom of each view in Traces Explorer has multiple helpful features.

</figure>


### Save View

At the Bottom of each View available in the Traces Explorer, we have an option to **Save this View** . What this does is, it saves the specific settings that you have applied for the particular View as a template which can be accessed later from the `Views Tab` available at the top or from `Select a View` dropdown. To know more details about Save View, please refer to this [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/product-features/saved-view/).

    <figcaption><i> Save view </i></figcaption>
</figure>



### Create an Alert

Just next to Save this view, we have the **Create an Alert** button which can be used to instantly create a [Trace based Alert](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/metrics-based-alerts/) according to the filters applied in our current view.

### Add to Dashboard

Next to Create an Alert, we have the **Add to Dashboard** button using which you can add the current panel to a New or any other existing dashboard.
