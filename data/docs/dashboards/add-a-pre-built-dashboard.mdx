In this guide, you will learn how to add a pre-built dashboard to SigNoz.

SigNoz provides a variety of out-of-the-box dashboards that you can use to monitor your applications and infrastructure. These pre-built dashboards are available on the [SigNoz website](https://signoz.io/dashboards).

### Steps to add a pre-built dashboard

1.  **Find a dashboard template**

    Navigate to the [Dashboards](https://signoz.io/dashboards) page on the SigNoz website to explore the available dashboard templates. You can find dashboards for various services like databases, web servers, and more.

2.  **Download the dashboard JSON**

    Select a dashboard that you want to use. For example, if you want to monitor a MySQL database, you can select the [MySQL dashboard](https://signoz.io/docs/dashboards/dashboard-templates/mysql/). On the dashboard page, you will find an option to download the dashboard as a JSON file. You can also copy the JSON content directly.
