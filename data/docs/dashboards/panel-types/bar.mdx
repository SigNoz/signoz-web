# Bar Chart

A Bar chart is a plot chart that shows frequency of a single or a few different categories over time. This helps in directly comparing the values of different categories, which correspond to the length of the bar. This is particularly useful when you have discrete categorical data and you want to highlight differences. 

## Data Formats

### Supported signals

- Logs
- Traces
- Metrics

This panel type supports any time series data. The time series data can be from logs, traces, or metrics.

### Examples

The following graph shows the requests per second (req/s) for a service over a period of time in bar chart.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/dashboards/panel-types/bar-chart.png" width="80%" alt="Bar chart for req/s over period of time"/>
    <figcaption><i>Bar chart for req/s over period of time.</i></figcaption>
</figure>


## Configuration

### Y-axis Unit

The unit of the y-axis. The default unit is `None`.

### Soft Min Max

The soft min max is used to adjust the y-axis scale for better visualization. By default, the soft min max is disabled and the y-axis range will be auto-adjusted based on the data. If the soft min max is enabled, the y-axis range will be adjusted to use the soft min max values. It is particularly useful when you want to prevent small values in the result from being magnified too much.

### Thresholds

Thresholds are used to draw a line on the y-axis to highlight the value. The thresholds are defined as a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the value and the color. The color is optional and if not provided, the default color will be used.
