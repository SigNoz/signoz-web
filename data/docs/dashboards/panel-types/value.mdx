# Value

Value panels are used to display a single value of a metric, APM, or log.

## Data Formats

### Supported signals

- Logs
- Traces
- Metrics

This panel type supports any time series data that can be aggregated to a single value. The time series data can be from logs, traces, or metrics.

### Setup

The following graph shows the combined average requests per second (req/s) for all services over a period of time.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/dashboards/panel-types/value.png" width="80%" alt="Value for req/s over period of time"/>
    <figcaption><i>Value for req/s over period of time.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Configuration

- Choose the signal type (logs, traces, metrics)
- Choose the metric, APM, or log to display
    - Metric: see the [Metrics query builder documentation](/docs/userguide/query-builder#metrics-query-builder) to configure metric query
    - Log: see the [Logs query builder documentation](/docs/userguide/query-builder#logs-and-traces-query-builder) to configure log query
    - Trace: see the [Traces query builder documentation](/docs/userguide/query-builder#logs-and-traces-query-builder) to configure trace query
- Reduce: choose the function to reduce the data (e.g. `avg`, `sum`, `max`, `min`, or `latest`). This step aggregates the data over the selected time period and returns a single value. For example, if you have a request rate over a period of time, the `avg` function will return the average of per-minute request rate over the period.

## Options

### Unit

The unit of the value. The default unit is `None`.


### Thresholds

Thresholds are used to configure the color of the value. The thresholds are defined as a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the value and the color. The color is optional and if not provided, the default color will be used.
