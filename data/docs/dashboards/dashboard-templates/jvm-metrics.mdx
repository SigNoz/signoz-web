## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential JVM runtime metrics to help you:

- **Monitor CPU Performance**: Track CPU utilization and processing time
- **Analyze Memory Usage**: Monitor heap, non-heap, and memory pool utilization
- **Track Garbage Collection**: Monitor GC frequency, duration, and performance impact
- **Monitor Thread States**: Track thread counts and states for concurrency analysis
- **Class Loading**: Monitor class loading and unloading patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize JVM performance
- **Resource Management**: Monitor memory pools and garbage collection efficiency

## Metrics Included

### CPU Metrics
- **CPU Count**: Shows number of available CPU cores
- **CPU Time**: Shows JVM CPU time consumption over time
- **CPU Recent Utilization**: Shows recent CPU utilization percentage

### Memory Metrics
- **Heap Usage**: Shows heap memory usage over time
- **Non-Heap Usage**: Shows non-heap memory usage over time
- **Old gen size**: Shows G1 Old Generation memory pool usage over time
- **Eden size**: Shows G1 Eden Space memory pool usage over time
- **Survivor size**: Shows G1 Survivor Space memory pool usage over time

### Thread Metrics
- **Timed waiting threads**: Shows count of threads in timed waiting state over time
- **Blocked threads**: Shows count of threads in blocked state over time
- **Daemon threads**: Shows count of daemon threads over time
- **Runnable threads**: Shows count of threads in runnable state over time
- **Live threads**: Shows count of live (non-daemon) threads over time

### Garbage Collection Metrics
- **GC Major & Minor Collection Time (p90)**: Shows 90th percentile garbage collection duration for major and minor collections over time
- **GC Major & Minor Collection Count**: Shows rate of major and minor garbage collection events over time
- **GC - Duration**: Shows garbage collection duration percentiles (p50, p90, p99) in table format
- **GC - p90 Duration**: Shows 90th percentile garbage collection duration over time

### Class Loading Metrics
- **Classes loaded**: Shows number of classes loaded over time
- **Classes loaded**: Shows number of classes unloaded over time (second graph)
