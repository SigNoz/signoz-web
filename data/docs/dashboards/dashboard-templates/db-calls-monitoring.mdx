title: DB Calls Monitoring Dashboard
description: Monitor comprehensive database operations including transaction rates, top DB statements, error rates, and slowest database calls for performance optimization.
---

This dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring of database operations and calls, offering detailed visibility into database transaction rates, top database statements, error rates, and slowest database calls. Built on top of available [DB attributes from OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/registry/attributes/db/).

## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential database metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Database Performance**: Track database transaction rates and response times
- **Identify Top Database Operations**: Analyze the most frequently executed database statements
- **Track Database Errors**: Monitor database error rates and identify problematic queries
- **Optimize Slow Queries**: Identify and analyze the slowest database calls for optimization
- **Database Health Monitoring**: Keep track of overall database system health and performance

## Metrics Included

### Transaction Rate Metrics
- **DB Transaction Rate**: Shows database transaction rate over time (req/s)

### Error Metrics
- **DB Error Rate**: Shows database error percentage over time

### Top Operations
- **Top DB Statements Table**: Shows database statements with dbName, db.statement, total calls, average duration, and rate

### Slowest DB Calls
- **Slowest DB Calls Table**: Shows slowest database operations with timestamp, serviceName, name, durationNano, db.statement, and dbOperation

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **service.name**: Filter by specific service names making database calls
