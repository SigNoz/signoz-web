## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential PostgreSQL metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Database Operations**: Track insert, update, delete, and heap update operations
- **Analyze Connection Management**: Monitor database connections and backend processes
- **Track Lock Activity**: Monitor database locks and deadlock occurrences
- **Table Performance**: Monitor table statistics, dead rows, and live rows
- **Index Efficiency**: Track index scans and index performance
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize database performance
- **Database Health**: Monitor overall database health and throughput

## Metrics Included

### Operation Metrics
- **Inserts**: Shows average number of database insert operations over time by database
- **Updates**: Shows average number of database update operations over time by database
- **Deleted**: Shows average number of database delete operations over time by database
- **Heap updates**: Shows average number of database heap-only update operations over time by database
- **Operation by database**: Table showing insert, update, and delete operation counts grouped by database

### Connection & Lock Metrics
- **Connections per db**: Shows number of backend connections per database over time
- **Locks by lock mode**: Shows number of database locks grouped by lock mode over time
- **Deadlocks count**: Shows rate of database deadlocks by database over time

### Table & Index Metrics
- **Dead rows**: Shows number of dead rows across selected tables over time
- **Index scans by index**: Shows rate of index scans grouped by index name over time
- **Table stats**: Comprehensive table showing dead rows, live rows, index scans, and table size by table name

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **host.name**: Filter by specific host sending PostgreSQL metrics (multi-select)
- **db.name**: Filter by specific database names (multi-select)
- **table.name**: Filter by specific table names (multi-select)
