## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential container metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Resource Utilization**: Track CPU and memory usage across all containers
- **Analyze Network Performance**: Monitor network traffic patterns and packet loss
- **Track Storage Operations**: Analyze disk I/O operations and performance
- **Identify Resource Bottlenecks**: Detect containers consuming excessive resources
- **Optimize Container Allocation**: Right-size container resource limits and requests
- **Container Health Monitoring**: Keep track of overall container performance and availability

## Metrics Included

### Resource Metrics
- **Container CPU Percent**: Shows CPU utilization percentage for each container over time
- **Container Memory Percent**: Shows memory utilization percentage for each container over time

### Memory Analysis
- **Mem Usage / Mem Limit Table**: Shows memory usage (MB) and memory limits (GB) for each container

### Network Metrics
- **Network Bytes Received**: Shows incoming network traffic in bytes for each container over time
- **Network Bytes Sent**: Shows outgoing network traffic in bytes for each container over time
- **Packets Dropped Table**: Shows incoming and outgoing packet drop counts for each container

### Storage Metrics
- **Block IO Table**: Shows block I/O operations (read/write) and throughput for each container

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **host.name**: Filter by specific host names to view containers on particular hosts
