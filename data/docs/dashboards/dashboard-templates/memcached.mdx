## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential Memcached metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Cache Operations**: Track command execution patterns and cache performance
- **Analyze Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption and server size trends
- **Track Connection Health**: Monitor client connections and connection patterns
- **Monitor Resource Utilization**: Track thread usage and system resources
- **Optimize Cache Performance**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize cache efficiency
- **Cache Management**: Monitor evictions and item management

## Metrics Included

### Performance Metrics
- **Commands**: Shows command execution rate grouped by command type (set, get, flush, touch) over time
- **Current Items**: Shows current number of items stored in memcached over time
- **Evictions**: Shows cache eviction rate over time

### Memory Metrics
- **Memcache Server Size (History)**: Shows historical memory usage of memcached server over time
- **Memcache Server (Current Size)**: Shows current memory usage of memcached server

### Connection Metrics
- **Current Connections**: Shows current number of active client connections
- **Total & Current Connections**: Shows both total connection rate and current active connections over time

### Resource Metrics
- **Threads Count**: Shows number of worker threads over time
