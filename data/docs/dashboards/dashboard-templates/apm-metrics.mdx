## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential application performance metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Application Latency**: Track response times across different percentiles (p50, p90, p99)
- **Request Rate Analysis**: Monitor incoming request volumes and traffic patterns
- **Error Rate Tracking**: Identify and track application errors and failure rates
- **Operation Performance**: Analyze performance of specific API endpoints and operations
- **External API Monitoring**: Track external service calls, error rates, and response times
- **Database Performance**: Monitor database call rates and average duration

## Metrics Included

### Overview Section

#### Latency Metrics
- **Latency Chart**: Shows p50, p99, and p90 percentile response times over time

#### Request Rate Metrics
- **Request Rate Chart**: Displays requests per second (rps) over time

#### Error Metrics
- **Error Percentage Chart**: Shows error percentage trends over time

#### Top Operations
- **Top Operations Table**: Performance metrics table showing operation names with p99, p90, and p50 latencies

### DB Metrics Section
- **DB Calls RPS**: Database calls requests per second
- **Database Calls Avg Duration**: Average duration of database calls

### External Calls Section
- **By External Address Stats Table**: Comprehensive table showing external API calls with:
  - **Address**: External service endpoints being called
  - **RPS**: Requests per second to each external service
  - **Error %**: Error percentage for external calls
  - **Avg Duration**: Average response time for external calls

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **deployment.environment**: Filter by deployment environment (production, staging, development, etc.)
- **service.name**: Filter by specific service names (supports multi-select)
- **top_level_operation**: Filter by top-level operations for the service
