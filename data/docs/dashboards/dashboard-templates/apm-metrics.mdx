## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential application performance metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Application Latency**: Track response times across different percentiles (p50, p90, p99)
- **Request Rate Analysis**: Monitor incoming request volumes and traffic patterns
- **Error Rate Tracking**: Identify and track application errors and failure rates
- **Operation Performance**: Analyze performance of specific API endpoints and operations
- **Service Health**: Get comprehensive insights into overall application health and performance

## Metrics Included

### Latency Metrics
- **P50 Latency**: Median response time - 50% of requests complete faster than this time
- **P90 Latency**: 90th percentile response time - 90% of requests complete faster than this time
- **P99 Latency**: 99th percentile response time - 99% of requests complete faster than this time
- **Latency Trends**: Historical latency patterns over time for performance analysis

### Request Rate Metrics
- **Requests per Second (RPS)**: Total number of incoming requests per second
- **Request Volume**: Overall traffic volume and patterns
- **Request Rate Trends**: Historical request rate patterns for capacity planning
- **Peak Traffic Analysis**: Identify high-traffic periods and usage patterns

### Error Metrics
- **Error Percentage**: Percentage of requests resulting in errors
- **Error Rate Trends**: Historical error rate patterns over time
- **Error Distribution**: Breakdown of different types of errors
- **Service Reliability**: Overall application reliability metrics

### Top Operations
- **Operation Performance Table**: Detailed performance metrics for individual API endpoints
- **Operation Latency Breakdown**: P99, P90, P50 latencies for each operation
- **Operation-Specific Metrics**: Performance analysis per API endpoint or service operation
- **Endpoint Comparison**: Compare performance across different operations

### Service Metrics
- **Service-Level Performance**: Metrics aggregated by service name
- **Cross-Service Analysis**: Performance comparison across multiple services
- **Service Health Indicators**: Overall health status of individual services
- **Service Dependencies**: Performance impact analysis across service boundaries

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **deployment.environment**: Filter by deployment environment (production, staging, development)
- **service.name**: Filter by specific service names (supports multi-select)
- **operation**: Filter by specific operations or API endpoints
- **http.method**: Filter by HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)

## Key Performance Indicators

### Golden Signals
This dashboard focuses on the four golden signals of monitoring:

1. **Latency**: How long it takes to service a request
2. **Traffic**: How much demand is being placed on your system
3. **Errors**: The rate of requests that fail
4. **Saturation**: How "full" your service is

### SLA Monitoring
- Track response time SLAs using percentile metrics
- Monitor error rate SLAs and service reliability
- Analyze availability and uptime metrics
- Identify SLA violations and performance degradations

## Use Cases

### Performance Optimization
- Identify slow API endpoints and operations
- Analyze latency trends to optimize response times
- Monitor the impact of code deployments on performance
- Track performance improvements over time

### Error Analysis
- Monitor application error rates and trends
- Identify problematic operations with high error rates
- Track error patterns and correlate with deployments
- Set up alerts for error rate thresholds

### Capacity Planning
- Analyze request rate trends for scaling decisions
- Monitor traffic patterns and peak usage periods
- Plan infrastructure scaling based on traffic growth
- Optimize resource allocation based on usage patterns

### Service Reliability
- Monitor overall service health and availability
- Track SLA compliance and service reliability metrics
- Identify performance bottlenecks across services
- Monitor the impact of dependencies on service performance
