## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential application performance metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Application Latency**: Track response times across different percentiles (p50, p90, p99)
- **Request Rate Analysis**: Monitor incoming request volumes and traffic patterns
- **Error Rate Tracking**: Identify and track application errors and failure rates
- **Operation Performance**: Analyze performance of specific API endpoints and operations
- **Service Health**: Get comprehensive insights into overall application health and performance

## Metrics Included

### Latency Metrics
- **P50 Latency**: Median response time - 50% of requests complete faster than this time
- **P90 Latency**: 90th percentile response time - 90% of requests complete faster than this time
- **P99 Latency**: 99th percentile response time - 99% of requests complete faster than this time

### Request Rate Metrics
- **Requests per Second (RPS)**: Total number of incoming requests per second
- **Request Volume**: Overall traffic volume and patterns
- **Request Rate Trends**: Historical request rate patterns for capacity planning
- **Peak Traffic Analysis**: Identify high-traffic periods and usage patterns

### Error Metrics
- **Error Percentage**: Percentage of requests resulting in errors
- **Error Rate Trends**: Historical error rate patterns over time

### Top Operations
- **Operation Performance Table**: Detailed performance metrics for individual API endpoints
- **Operation Latency Breakdown**: P99, P90, P50 latencies for each operation

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **deployment.environment**: Filter by deployment environment (production, staging, development)
- **service.name**: Filter by specific service names (supports multi-select)
- **top_level_operation**: The primary operations for the service
