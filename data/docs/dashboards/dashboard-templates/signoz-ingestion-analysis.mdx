## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential ingestion metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Data Volume**: Track the total volume of metrics, traces, and logs being ingested
- **Cost Optimization**: Identify high-volume data sources that may impact costs
- **Capacity Planning**: Understand ingestion patterns for better resource allocation
- **Volume Analysis**: Break down ingestion by service, environment, and data type
- **Ingestion Health**: Monitor the health and patterns of your data ingestion pipeline

## Key Features

### Time Range Focus
- **15-minute window**: Shows only the last 15 minutes of data for real-time volume analysis
- **Recent volume tracking**: Designed to help understand current ingestion patterns
- **Real-time insights**: Provides immediate feedback on data ingestion changes

### Cost Optimization Guides
The dashboard includes links to comprehensive guides for controlling data volume:
- **Metrics**: [How to drop metrics](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/drop-metrics/)
- **Logs**: [How to drop logs](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-management/guides/drop-logs/)
- **Traces**: [How to drop spans](https://signoz.io/docs/traces-management/guides/drop-spans/)

## Metrics Included

### Metrics Ingestion
- **Total Samples**: Total count of metric samples ingested
- **Volume Breakdown by Metric Name**: Top 100 metrics by sample count
- **Volume by Environment**: Breakdown of metrics by deployment environment
- **Volume by Service**: Metrics volume per service
- **Volume by Environment and Metric**: Combined breakdown showing environment and metric correlations
- **Host Monitoring**: Check if specific hosts are sending metrics
- **Kubernetes Monitoring**: Monitor metrics from clusters, nodes, and namespaces
- **Report Interval Analysis**: Observe the reporting frequency for metric-service combinations

### Traces Ingestion
- **Total Spans**: Total count of spans ingested
- **Spans by Environment and Service**: Breakdown of span volume by environment and service
- **Spans by Operation Name**: Volume analysis per span operation/endpoint
- **Attribute Analysis**: List of all span attributes and resource attributes being ingested

### Logs Ingestion
- **Total Logs**: Total count of log records ingested
- **Logs by Environment and Service**: Volume breakdown by environment and service
- **Logs by Severity Level**: Distribution of log levels (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG, etc.)
- **Logs by File Path**: Volume breakdown by log file sources
- **Log Attributes**: List of all log record and resource attributes

## Dashboard Sections

### Metrics Ingestion Section
Provides comprehensive analysis of metric sample ingestion including:
- Overview of total samples ingested
- Detailed breakdowns by metric name, environment, and service
- Infrastructure monitoring status checks
- Reporting interval analysis for optimization

### Traces Section
Focuses on distributed tracing data ingestion with:
- Total span count monitoring
- Service and environment breakdown
- Operation-level analysis
- Attribute inventory for optimization

### Logs Section
Covers log ingestion monitoring including:
- Total log volume tracking
- Service and environment analysis
- Log level distribution
- File path breakdown for source identification

## Use Cases

### Cost Management
- **Identify High-Volume Sources**: Quickly spot services or metrics generating excessive data
- **Environment Comparison**: Compare ingestion volumes across different environments
- **Resource Planning**: Plan infrastructure based on ingestion patterns
- **Budget Optimization**: Use volume data to optimize observability costs

### Data Governance
- **Attribute Management**: Review all attributes being ingested for optimization
- **Data Quality**: Monitor reporting intervals and data consistency
- **Source Monitoring**: Track which hosts and services are actively sending data
- **Volume Control**: Implement data dropping strategies based on volume analysis

### Performance Optimization
- **Ingestion Patterns**: Understand peak ingestion periods
- **Service Analysis**: Identify services with unusual ingestion patterns
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Ensure all expected sources are reporting data
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Get immediate insights into ingestion changes

### Troubleshooting
- **Missing Data Detection**: Quickly identify if hosts or services stopped sending data
- **Volume Spikes**: Detect unexpected increases in data volume
- **Attribute Debugging**: Review all attributes being collected for debugging
- **Service Health**: Monitor ingestion health across services and environments

## Important Notes

- **Time Window**: Dashboard shows only the last 15 minutes of data for focused analysis
- **Volume Limits**: Tables show top 100 entries by volume to focus on highest impact sources
- **Real-time Focus**: Designed for understanding current ingestion patterns rather than historical analysis
- **Optimization Ready**: Includes direct links to SigNoz guides for dropping unwanted data

## Setup Requirements

This dashboard works out-of-the-box with any SigNoz installation that has:
- Metrics ingestion enabled
- Traces collection configured  
- Logs collection configured

No additional configuration is required as it analyzes data already stored in SigNoz's internal tables.
