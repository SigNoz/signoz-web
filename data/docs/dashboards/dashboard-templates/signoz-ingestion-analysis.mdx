title: SigNoz Ingestion Analysis Dashboard
description: Monitor and analyze the volume of metrics, traces, and logs ingested into SigNoz for cost optimization and capacity planning.
---

This dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring of data ingestion volumes into SigNoz, offering detailed visibility into metrics, traces, and logs consumption patterns. It's specifically designed to help with cost optimization by analyzing ingestion volumes and identifying high-volume data sources.

## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential ingestion metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Data Volume**: Track the total volume of metrics, traces, and logs being ingested
- **Cost Optimization**: Identify high-volume data sources that may impact costs
- **Capacity Planning**: Understand ingestion patterns for better resource allocation
- **Volume Analysis**: Break down ingestion by service, environment, and data type
- **Ingestion Health**: Monitor the health and patterns of your data ingestion pipeline

## Key Features

### Time Range Focus
- **15-minute window**: Shows only the last 15 minutes of data for real-time volume analysis
- **Recent volume tracking**: Designed to help understand current ingestion patterns
- **Real-time insights**: Provides immediate feedback on data ingestion changes

### Cost Optimization Guides
The dashboard includes links to comprehensive guides for controlling data volume:
- **Metrics**: [How to drop metrics](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/drop-metrics/)
- **Logs**: [How to drop logs](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-management/guides/drop-logs/)
- **Traces**: [How to drop spans](https://signoz.io/docs/traces-management/guides/drop-spans/)

## Metrics Included

### Logs Ingestion
- **Total Logs**: Total count of log records ingested
- **Logs by Environment and Service**: Volume breakdown by environment and service
- **Logs by Severity Level**: Distribution of log levels (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG, etc.)
- **Logs by File Path**: Volume breakdown by log file sources
- **Log Attributes**: List of all log record and resource attributes

### Traces Ingestion
- **Total Spans**: Total count of spans ingested
- **Spans by Environment and Service**: Breakdown of span volume by environment and service
- **Spans by Operation Name**: Volume analysis per span operation/endpoint
- **Attribute Analysis**: List of all span attributes and resource attributes being ingested

### Metrics Ingestion
- **Total Samples**: Total count of metric samples ingested
- **Volume Breakdown by Metric Name**: Top 100 metrics by sample count
- **Volume by Environment**: Breakdown of metrics by deployment environment
- **Volume by Service**: Metrics volume per service
- **Volume by Environment and Metric**: Combined breakdown showing environment and metric correlations
- **Host Monitoring**: Check if specific hosts are sending metrics
- **Kubernetes Monitoring**: Monitor metrics from clusters, nodes, and namespaces
- **Report Interval Analysis**: Observe the reporting frequency for metric-service combinations

## Important Notes

- **Time Window**: Dashboard shows only the last 15 minutes of data for focused analysis
- **Volume Limits**: Tables show top 100 entries by volume to focus on highest impact sources
- **Real-time Focus**: Designed for understanding current ingestion patterns rather than historical analysis

{/* ## Setup Requirements

This dashboard works out-of-the-box with any SigNoz installation that has:
- Metrics ingestion enabled
- Traces collection configured  
- Logs collection configured

No additional configuration is required as it analyzes data already stored in SigNoz's internal tables. */}
