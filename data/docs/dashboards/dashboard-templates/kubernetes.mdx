# Kubernetes Dashboards

Monitor your Kubernetes cluster with comprehensive dashboards designed to provide detailed insights into pod and node-level performance. These dashboards help you track resource utilization, identify bottlenecks, and ensure optimal cluster health.

## Available Kubernetes Dashboards

## Why Monitor Kubernetes?

Kubernetes monitoring is essential for maintaining cluster health and application performance. These dashboards provide:

- **Resource Optimization**: Track CPU and memory usage across pods and nodes
- **Performance Troubleshooting**: Identify bottlenecks and resource constraints
- **Capacity Planning**: Monitor resource utilization trends for scaling decisions
- **Health Monitoring**: Keep track of pod restarts, network activity, and filesystem usage

## Dashboard Features

Both Kubernetes dashboards include:

- **Real-time Metrics**: Live monitoring of your cluster components
- **Filtering Variables**: Filter by cluster name, namespace, node, and pod names
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: CPU, memory, filesystem, and network metrics
- **Ready-to-Import**: JSON templates ready for immediate use in SigNoz

## How to Use

1. **Choose Your Dashboard**: Select either Pod Metrics or Node Metrics based on your monitoring needs
2. **Download JSON**: Use the download button on each dashboard page to get the JSON file
3. **Import to SigNoz**: Follow our [dashboard import guide](/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/) to import into your SigNoz instance
4. **Configure Variables**: Set your cluster name and other variables to start monitoring
