## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential CouchDB metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Request Performance**: Track HTTP request patterns and response times
- **Analyze HTTP Traffic**: Monitor different HTTP methods and their usage patterns
- **Track Response Status**: Analyze success and error response rates
- **Monitor Database Operations**: Track read and write operations performance
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor open databases and file descriptors
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize database operations

## Metrics Included

### Performance Metrics
- **Average Request Time**: Shows average HTTP request response time in milliseconds over time

### HTTP Traffic Metrics
- **HTTP Requests**: Shows HTTP request rate grouped by HTTP method (GET, PUT, POST, HEAD, DELETE, COPY, OPTIONS) over time
- **Success HTTP Responses**: Shows successful HTTP response rate (2xx status codes) grouped by HTTP method over time
- **Error HTTP Responses**: Shows error HTTP response rate (non-2xx status codes) grouped by HTTP method over time

### Database Operation Metrics
- **Operations (Reads/Writes)**: Shows database operation rates grouped by operation type (reads, writes) over time

### Resource Metrics
- **Open Databases**: Shows current number of open databases
- **Opened File Descriptors**: Shows current number of opened file descriptors
