## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential host system metrics to help you:

- **Monitor System Resources**: Track CPU and memory usage across Kubernetes hosts
- **Disk Performance**: Monitor disk I/O operations, usage, and performance metrics
- **Network Activity**: Observe network traffic, bandwidth utilization, and interface statistics
- **Filesystem Management**: Monitor disk space usage, available capacity, and filesystem health
- **Infrastructure Health**: Identify performance bottlenecks and resource constraints at the host level

## Metrics Included

### Overview Metrics
- **CPU Used**: Current CPU utilization percentage across all cores
- **Allocatable CPU**: Total CPU resources available for allocation
- **Memory Used**: Current memory consumption in GiB
- **Allocatable Memory**: Total memory available for allocation in GiB

### CPU Metrics
- **CPU Usage**: Real-time CPU utilization trends over time
- **CPU Load Average**: System load averages (1min, 5min, 15min)
- **CPU Usage by Core**: Per-core CPU utilization breakdown
- **CPU Wait Time**: Time spent waiting for I/O operations

### Memory Metrics
- **Memory Usage**: Current memory consumption trends
- **Memory Available**: Available memory for new processes
- **Memory Buffers/Cache**: System buffers and cached memory
- **Memory Swap Usage**: Swap space utilization
- **Memory Utilization by Type**: Breakdown of memory usage types

### Disk Metrics
- **Disk I/O Operations**: Read and write IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)
- **Disk Throughput**: Data transfer rates in MB/s for read and write operations
- **Disk Usage**: Storage space consumption across mounted filesystems
- **Disk Queue Depth**: Average number of pending I/O operations
- **Disk Latency**: Read and write operation latencies

### Network Metrics
- **Network I/O**: Incoming and outgoing network traffic
- **Network Packet Rates**: Packets transmitted and received per second
- **Network Interface Utilization**: Bandwidth usage per network interface
- **Network Errors**: Error rates and dropped packets
- **Network Connections**: Active network connections and states

### Filesystem Metrics
- **Filesystem Usage**: Disk space utilization by mount point
- **Filesystem Available**: Available disk space for each filesystem
- **Filesystem Capacity**: Total capacity of mounted filesystems
- **Inode Usage**: File system inode utilization
- **Filesystem Read/Write Operations**: File system level I/O metrics

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **k8s.cluster.name**: Filter by Kubernetes cluster name
- **k8s.node.name**: Filter by specific node names (supports multi-select)
- **host.name**: Filter by hostname
- **service.name**: Filter by service name

## Use Cases

### Capacity Planning
- Monitor resource utilization trends to plan for scaling
- Identify nodes approaching resource limits
- Analyze historical usage patterns for better resource allocation

### Performance Troubleshooting
- Identify CPU, memory, or I/O bottlenecks
- Correlate application performance issues with host metrics
- Monitor system health during high load periods

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Track overall cluster health at the host level
- Monitor filesystem usage to prevent disk space issues
- Observe network performance and identify connectivity problems
