## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential host system metrics to help you:

- **Monitor System Resources**: Track CPU and memory usage across Kubernetes hosts
- **Disk Performance**: Monitor disk I/O operations, usage, and performance metrics
- **Network Activity**: Observe network traffic, bandwidth utilization, and interface statistics
- **Filesystem Management**: Monitor disk space usage, available capacity, and filesystem health
- **Infrastructure Health**: Identify performance bottlenecks and resource constraints at the host level

## Metrics Included

### Overview Section
- **CPU Used**: Current CPU utilization value
- **Allocatable CPU**: Total CPU resources available for allocation
- **Memory Used**: Current memory consumption in GiB
- **Allocatable Memory**: Total memory available for allocation in GiB

### Resources Section
- **CPU Usage Chart**: Real-time CPU utilization breakdown by type (user, idle, system, softirq, wait, steal, interrupt, irq, nice)
- **Memory Usage Chart**: Memory consumption breakdown by type (used, free, cached, slab_reclaimable, buffered, slab_unreclaimable)
- **CPU Usage by Namespace**: CPU utilization per Kubernetes namespace
- **Memory Usage by Namespace**: Memory consumption per Kubernetes namespace
- **CPU Usage by Pod**: CPU utilization per individual pod
- **Memory Usage by Pod**: Memory consumption per individual pod

### System Section
- **System Load Average**: System load averages over 1min, 5min, and 15min intervals

### Network Section
- **Network Usage (Bytes)**: Network traffic in bytes for transmit and receive operations
- **Network Usage (Packet/s)**: Network traffic in packets per second
- **Network Errors**: Network error rates and failed transmissions
- **Network Drops**: Dropped network packets
- **Network Connections**: Active network connections by TCP state (TIME_WAIT, ESTABLISHED, LISTEN, etc.)

### Disk Section
- **System Disk I/O (Bytes Transferred)**: Data transfer rates for read and write operations
- **System Disk Operations/s**: Disk operations per second for various devices
- **Disk Operations Time**: Time taken for disk operations
- **Queue Size**: Disk I/O queue size

### Filesystem Section
- **File System Usage Table**: Tabular view showing device, mountpoint, state, and filesystem type
- **File System Inode Usage Table**: Inode utilization showing device, mountpoint, state, and type

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **k8s.cluster.name**: Filter by Kubernetes cluster name
- **k8s.node.name**: Filter by specific node names
