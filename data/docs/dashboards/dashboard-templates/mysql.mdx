## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential MySQL metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Connection Health**: Track database connections and connection errors
- **Analyze Lock Performance**: Monitor MySQL locks and row-level locking behavior
- **Track Buffer Pool Usage**: Analyze InnoDB buffer pool efficiency and page management
- **Monitor Table I/O Operations**: Track table-level I/O wait events and performance
- **Analyze Resource Utilization**: Monitor threads, handlers, and prepared statements
- **Database Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize database operations

## Metrics Included

### Connection Metrics
- **Connection/Errors**: Shows database connection count and connection errors over time

### Performance Metrics
- **Count by Handlers**: Shows MySQL handler operations count by type over time
- **Row Operations**: Shows row-level operations (read, insert, delete, update) over time
- **Count of Operations**: Shows count of database operations by operation type

### Lock Metrics
- **MySQL Locks**: Shows MySQL lock types (immediate, waited) over time
- **Row Locks**: Shows InnoDB row lock operations (waits, time) over time

### Resource Metrics
- **Open Resources Count**: Shows count of open MySQL resources by type over time
- **Thread Type Count**: Shows MySQL thread counts by thread type (running, connected, created, cached)
- **Prepared Statement Count**: Shows prepared statement counts by command type

### Storage Metrics
- **InnoDB Log Operations**: Shows InnoDB log operations count by operation type

### Buffer Pool Metrics
- **Buffer Pool Usage by Status**: Shows buffer pool memory usage by status (clean, dirty) over time
- **Data Pages by Status**: Shows buffer pool data pages by status (clean, dirty) over time
- **Buffer Pool Pages by Kind**: Shows buffer pool pages count by page kind over time
- **Total Buffer Pool Page Flushes**: Shows total count of buffer pool page flush operations over time

### Table I/O Metrics
- **Count of Table I/O Wait Events**: Shows count of table I/O wait events by table
- **Table I/O Wait Events Time**: Shows time spent in table I/O wait events by table

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **deployment.environment**: Filter by deployment environment 
- **mysql.instance.endpoint**: Filter by specific MySQL instance endpoints
