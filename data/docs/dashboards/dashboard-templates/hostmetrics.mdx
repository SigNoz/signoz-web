# Host Metrics Dashboards

Monitor your infrastructure with comprehensive dashboards designed to provide detailed insights into host-level system performance. These dashboards help you track resource utilization, system health, and infrastructure performance across different environments.

## Available Host Metrics Dashboards

## Why Monitor Host Metrics?

Host-level monitoring is essential for maintaining optimal infrastructure health and performance. These dashboards provide:

- **Resource Monitoring**: Track CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization across your hosts
- **System Health**: Monitor system load, filesystem usage, and process performance
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Specialized metrics for containerized environments running on Kubernetes
- **Capacity Planning**: Historical data for infrastructure scaling and resource allocation decisions

## Dashboard Features

Host Metrics dashboards include:

- **Real-time Metrics**: Live monitoring of your infrastructure components
- **Filtering Variables**: Filter by cluster name, node name, and environment
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: CPU, memory, disk, network, and filesystem metrics
- **Ready-to-Import**: JSON templates ready for immediate use in SigNoz

## How to Use

1. **Choose Your Dashboard**: Select the appropriate host metrics dashboard based on your infrastructure setup
2. **Download JSON**: Use the download button on each dashboard page to get the JSON file
3. **Import to SigNoz**: Follow our [dashboard import guide](/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/) to import into your SigNoz instance
4. **Configure Variables**: Set your cluster and host variables to start monitoring
