title: HTTP API Monitoring Dashboard
description: Monitor HTTP API performance with comprehensive metrics including endpoint latency, status code distribution, external API calls, and request patterns built on OpenTelemetry HTTP attributes.
---

This dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring of HTTP API performance, offering detailed visibility into endpoint latency, status code distribution, external API calls, and request patterns. Built on top of available HTTP attributes from OpenTelemetry, it enables teams to track and optimize their HTTP-based services.

## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential HTTP API performance metrics to help you:

- **Monitor HTTP Endpoint Performance**: Track response times and throughput for individual API endpoints
- **Status Code Analysis**: Monitor HTTP status code distribution to identify error patterns
- **External API Monitoring**: Track outbound HTTP calls to external services and their performance
- **Latency Analysis**: Analyze P90 latency trends across different HTTP routes and methods
- **Slowest Calls Identification**: Identify and investigate the slowest HTTP requests for optimization

## Metrics Included

### Core HTTP Monitoring

#### Top HTTP Endpoints
- **Top HTTP Endpoints Table**: Comprehensive view of your busiest API endpoints showing:
  - **HTTP Route**: The API endpoint route (e.g., `/api/users`, `/api/orders`)
  - **HTTP Method**: Request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
  - **Count**: Total number of requests to each endpoint
  - **Avg Duration**: Average response time for each endpoint

#### HTTP Status Code Distribution
- **Status Code Graph**: Time-series visualization showing HTTP status code distribution:
  - **2xx Success Codes**: Successful requests
  - **4xx Client Errors**: Client-side errors (400, 401, 404, etc.)
  - **5xx Server Errors**: Server-side errors (500, 503, etc.)
  - Grouped by HTTP route for detailed analysis

### Performance Analysis

#### HTTP Endpoint Latency - P90
- **P90 Latency Graph**: Track 90th percentile response times over time:
  - Segmented by HTTP route and method combinations
  - Helps identify performance degradation trends
  - Essential for SLA monitoring and performance optimization

#### Slowest HTTP Calls
- **Slowest Calls List**: Real-time view of the slowest HTTP requests showing:
  - **Service Name**: Which service handled the request
  - **Operation Name**: Specific operation being performed
  - **Duration**: Response time in nanoseconds
  - Ordered by duration (slowest first) for quick identification

### External Dependencies

#### External HTTP APIs
- **External APIs Table**: Monitor outbound HTTP calls to external services:
  - **External URL**: The external service endpoints being called
  - **HTTP Method**: Request methods used for external calls
  - **Total Calls**: Count of calls made to each external service
  - **Request Rate**: Requests per second to external services
  - **P90 Duration**: 90th percentile response time for external calls

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **service.name**: Filter by specific service names to focus on particular applications or microservices

## Use Cases

### Performance Optimization
- Identify slow-performing endpoints using the P90 latency graph
- Find bottlenecks in external API calls that might affect overall performance
- Monitor trends in response times to detect performance regressions

### Error Monitoring
- Track error rates through HTTP status code distribution
- Quickly identify which endpoints are generating the most errors
- Monitor external API reliability and error patterns

### Capacity Planning
- Analyze request patterns and volumes for different endpoints
- Understand traffic distribution across your API surface
- Plan scaling decisions based on endpoint usage patterns

### Troubleshooting
- Use the slowest calls list to identify specific problematic requests
- Correlate external API performance with internal service performance
- Analyze status code patterns to understand failure modes

## Best Practices

1. **Set up Alerts**: Create alerts based on P90 latency thresholds for critical endpoints
2. **Monitor External Dependencies**: Keep an eye on external API performance as it can impact your service SLAs
3. **Track Error Rates**: Set up monitoring for unusual spikes in 4xx and 5xx error rates
4. **Regular Review**: Regularly review the slowest calls to identify optimization opportunities
