## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks critical performance metrics for your LLM application using OpenTelemetry to help you:

- **Monitor Token Usage**: Track the total number of input and output tokens processed by your application to understand workload volume.
- **Analyze Throughput Efficiency**: Monitor connection acceptance, handling, and current states
- **Track Server Performance**: Visualize the rate of token generation over time to assess performance trends.
- **Track Latency Behavior**: Measure request latency—including p99 latency and high-latency request percentages—to identify and address performance slowdowns.
- **Identify Bottlenecks**: Spot token generation or latency inefficiencies and use historical patterns to guide optimization.
- **Ensure Application Responsiveness**: Monitor the percentage of slow responses (>=1000ms) to maintain reliable LLM performance and user experience.

## Metrics Included

### Overview Metrics (Value Panels)
- **Total Input Tokens**: Displays the total number of input tokens sent to the LLM within the selected time frame.
- **Total Output Tokens**: Displays the total number of output tokens generated by the LLM in the selected time frame.
- **% of Requests ≥ 1000ms**: Shows the percentage of requests with latency ≥ 1000ms; the value turns orange above 5% and red above 10% to highlight degradation.

### Trend Analysis (Graphs)
- **Tokens Per Second Generated**: A line graph showing the average number of tokens generated per second, helping visualize LLM throughput efficiency.
- **Latency (p99)**: A time-series chart showing the 99th percentile latency in milliseconds across all LLM requests, highlighting peak delay patterns.
