## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential NGINX metrics using OpenTelemetry to help you:

- **Monitor Request Processing**: Track incoming requests and request handling patterns
- **Analyze Connection Management**: Monitor connection acceptance, handling, and current states
- **Track Server Performance**: Monitor active connections and connection states
- **Connection State Analysis**: Monitor writing, waiting, reading, and active connection states
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize server configuration
- **Server Health**: Monitor overall NGINX server health and throughput

## Metrics Included

### Overview Metrics (Value Panels)
- **New requests**: Shows current count of new requests processed
- **Accepted connections**: Shows current count of accepted connections
- **Handled connections**: Shows current count of handled connections
- **Active**: Shows current count of active connections
- **Writing**: Shows current count of connections in writing state
- **Waiting**: Shows current count of connections in waiting state

### Trend Analysis (Graphs)
- **Current conns**: Shows current connections over time grouped by connection state (writing, active, reading, waiting)
- **Requests**: Shows request count trends over time
- **Accepted conns**: Shows accepted connections trends over time
- **Handled conns**: Shows handled connections trends over time

## OpenTelemetry Integration

This dashboard uses OpenTelemetry metrics for NGINX monitoring, providing:

- **Standardized metrics collection** using the OpenTelemetry NGINX receiver
- **Consistent metric naming** following OpenTelemetry conventions
- **Native integration** with OpenTelemetry-based observability stacks
- **Scalable monitoring** across multiple NGINX instances
