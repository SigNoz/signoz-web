## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential Apache HTTP Server metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Request Handling**: Track request volume and processing patterns
- **Analyze CPU Performance**: Monitor CPU load and processing time
- **Track Worker Processes**: Monitor busy and idle worker states
- **Analyze Traffic Patterns**: Monitor data transfer and bandwidth usage
- **Server Load Monitoring**: Track system load averages over different time periods
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize server configuration
- **Resource Management**: Monitor worker thread utilization and efficiency

## Metrics Included

### Overview Metrics
- **No of Requests**: Shows total number of requests processed
- **CPULoad**: Shows current CPU load percentage
- **Busy workers**: Shows number of busy worker processes
- **Idle workers**: Shows number of idle worker processes

### Performance Metrics
- **Apache CPU Load**: Shows minimum and maximum CPU load over time
- **Apache CPU Time**: Shows CPU time consumption grouped by mode and level
- **Average Server Load**: Shows system load averages for 1, 5, and 15-minute intervals

### Traffic Metrics
- **Traffic**: Shows total HTTP server traffic in bytes over time
- **Concurrency Efficiency: Average Workers vs. Requests**: Shows relationship between worker processes and request volume

### Worker State Metrics
- **Scoreboard**: Shows detailed breakdown of worker process states including:
  - **open**: Available slots
  - **waiting**: Waiting for connection
  - **sending**: Sending reply
  - **starting**: Starting up
  - **keepalive**: Keep-alive connections
  - **finishing**: Gracefully finishing
  - **reading**: Reading request
  - **dnslookup**: DNS lookup
  - **idle_cleanup**: Idle cleanup
  - **logging**: Logging
