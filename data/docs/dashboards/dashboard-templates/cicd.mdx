title: CI/CD Dashboard
description: Monitor comprehensive CI/CD pipeline performance including repository metrics, change management, pipeline duration, and deployment status across any VCS provider with semantic metrics support.
---

This dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring of CI/CD pipeline performance and repository activity, offering detailed visibility into repository metrics, change management processes, pipeline execution times, and deployment statuses. This dashboard will work with any VCS provider which sends [semantic metrics](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/cicd/cicd-metrics/).

## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential CI/CD metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Repository Activity**: Track branches, changes, and contributor activity
- **Analyze Change Management**: Monitor approval times, merge times, and change lifecycle
- **Track Pipeline Performance**: Analyze pipeline duration, success rates, and bottlenecks
- **Optimize Development Workflow**: Identify inefficiencies in code review and deployment processes
- **Measure DORA Metrics**: Track change lead time and deployment frequency
- **VCS Provider Agnostic**: Works with any version control system that sends semantic metrics

## Metrics Included

### Repository Metrics
- **# Branches**: Shows average number of branches in the repository
- **Branch Age**: Shows average age of branches in the repository
- **# Contributors**: Shows number of contributors over time
- **# Lines Changed**: Shows distribution of lines added vs removed in a pie chart

### Change Management Metrics
- **# Changes**: Shows average number of changes in open state
- **Change Age**: Shows average time a change remains in open state
- **Change Approval Time**: Shows average time taken to approve a change
- **Change Merge Time**: Shows average time taken to merge a change (part of DORA Change Lead Time metric)
- **# Changes**: Shows number of changes by state over time
- **Change Merge Time (detailed)**: Shows minimum, average, and maximum merge times over time

### Pipeline Metrics
- **Pipeline Duration**: Shows average pipeline duration by pipeline name
- **Pipeline Duration (P50)**: Shows P50 pipeline duration over time by pipeline name
- **# Statuses**: Shows pipeline run counts grouped by status (success, failure, etc.)
- **# Statuses**: Shows pipeline statuses over time by pipeline name and status

### Detailed Analysis
- **# Changes (detailed)**: Shows detailed breakdown of changes including age, merge time, approval time, lines added, and lines removed by branch name
- **Pipeline Duration (detailed)**: Shows detailed pipeline duration breakdown with P50, P90, and P99 percentiles by pipeline name

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **repository.name**: Filter by specific repository name
