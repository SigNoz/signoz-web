## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential application performance metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Key Operations**: Focus on the most important API endpoints and operations
- **Track Golden Signals**: Monitor latency, traffic, errors, and performance indicators
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify slow operations and performance bottlenecks
- **Error Analysis**: Track error rates and identify problematic endpoints
- **SLA Monitoring**: Ensure critical operations meet performance requirements

## Key Features

### Top 20 Focus
- **High-Impact Operations**: Automatically displays the top 20 operations by volume and performance
- **Performance Ranking**: Shows operations ordered by their impact on user experience
- **Critical Path Monitoring**: Focus on the most important operations for your business

### Golden Signals Coverage
Complete coverage of the four golden signals of monitoring:
1. **Latency**: Response time percentiles (P50, P90, P99)
2. **Traffic**: Request rates and throughput
3. **Errors**: Error percentages and failure rates
4. **Saturation**: Implicit through performance degradation patterns

## Metrics Included

### Latency Metrics
- **P99 Latency (Top 20)**: 99th percentile response times for the highest-volume operations
- **P90 Latency**: 90th percentile response times for consistent performance monitoring
- **P50 Latency**: Median response times for baseline performance tracking
- **Average Latency Table**: Comprehensive view of P99/P90/P50 latencies for all operations
- **Latency Trends**: Historical latency patterns for performance analysis

### Request Rate Metrics
- **Request Rate (Top 20)**: Requests per second for the busiest operations
- **Average Request Rate Table**: Request rates for all operations in tabular format
- **Traffic Patterns**: Historical request volume trends
- **Throughput Analysis**: Overall system throughput and capacity utilization

### Error Metrics
- **Error Percentage (Top 20)**: Error rates for the most critical operations
- **Average Error Percentage Table**: Error rates for all operations
- **Error Trends**: Historical error rate patterns
- **Reliability Tracking**: Service reliability and availability metrics

### Performance Tables
- **Comprehensive Operation View**: Tabular data showing all operations with their key metrics
- **Performance Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of latency, errors, and throughput
- **Operation Ranking**: Operations sorted by performance impact
- **Historical Averages**: Time-averaged metrics for trend analysis

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **deployment.environment**: Filter by deployment environment (production, staging, development)
- **service.name**: Filter by specific service names to focus on particular applications

## Use Cases

### Performance Monitoring
- **SLA Tracking**: Monitor critical operations against performance SLAs
- **Performance Degradation**: Quickly identify when key operations slow down
- **Capacity Planning**: Use traffic patterns for scaling decisions
- **Optimization Targeting**: Focus optimization efforts on high-impact operations

### Error Management
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Track error rates for business-critical operations
- **Reliability Analysis**: Monitor service reliability across key endpoints
- **Incident Response**: Quickly identify failing operations during incidents
- **Error Pattern Analysis**: Identify operations with consistently high error rates

### Business Impact Analysis
- **Critical Path Monitoring**: Focus on operations that directly impact business outcomes
- **User Experience**: Monitor operations that most affect user experience
- **Revenue Impact**: Track performance of revenue-generating endpoints
- **Customer-Facing Operations**: Prioritize customer-facing API performance

### Development and Operations
- **Deployment Impact**: Monitor key operations after deployments
- **Performance Regression**: Detect performance regressions in critical operations
- **Load Testing Validation**: Validate performance under load for key operations
- **Service Dependencies**: Understand performance impact across service boundaries

## Key Performance Indicators

### Latency SLAs
- **P99 < 500ms**: Critical operations should complete within 500ms for 99% of requests
- **P90 < 200ms**: Most operations should complete within 200ms for 90% of requests
- **P50 < 100ms**: Median response time should be under 100ms for good user experience

### Error Rate Targets
- **< 0.1% Error Rate**: Critical operations should maintain very low error rates
- **< 1% Error Rate**: Most operations should keep errors under 1%
- **Zero Critical Errors**: Business-critical operations should have zero errors

### Throughput Baselines
- **Consistent Request Rates**: Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
- **Peak Capacity**: Understand maximum throughput for capacity planning
- **Traffic Growth**: Track growth trends for scaling decisions

## Dashboard Insights

### Operation Prioritization
This dashboard automatically focuses on your most important operations by showing:
- **Top 20 by Volume**: Operations with the highest request rates
- **Performance Impact**: Operations with the most significant latency impact
- **Error-Prone Operations**: Operations with higher error rates requiring attention

### Performance Correlation
- **Latency vs. Traffic**: Understand how increased traffic affects response times
- **Error vs. Load**: Identify if errors increase under higher load
- **Performance Patterns**: Recognize daily/weekly performance patterns
