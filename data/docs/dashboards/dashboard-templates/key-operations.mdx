## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential application performance metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Key Operations**: Focus on the most important API endpoints and operations
- **Track Golden Signals**: Monitor latency, traffic, errors, and performance indicators
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify slow operations and performance bottlenecks
- **Error Analysis**: Track error rates and identify problematic endpoints
- **SLA Monitoring**: Ensure critical operations meet performance requirements

## Metrics Included

### Latency Metrics
- **P99 Latency (Top 20)**: 99th percentile response times chart for the highest-volume operations
- **Average p99/95/50 Latency (All)**: Comprehensive table showing operation names with p99, p90, and p50 latencies for all operations

### Request Rate Metrics
- **Request Rate (Top 20)**: Requests per second chart for the busiest operations showing traffic patterns

### Error Metrics
- **Average Error Percentage (All)**: Table showing operation names and their corresponding error percentages

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **deployment.environment**: Filter by deployment environment (production, staging, development)
- **service.name**: Filter by specific service names to focus on particular applications
