## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential Kubernetes pod metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Pod Performance**: Track CPU and memory usage for individual pods
- **Resource Optimization**: Analyze resource consumption patterns across pods
- **Network Activity**: Monitor network I/O and traffic patterns per pod
- **Filesystem Performance**: Track filesystem usage and storage consumption
- **Pod Health**: Monitor pod restarts and identify performance bottlenecks

## Metrics Included

### Memory Metrics
- **Pod Memory Working Set**: Active memory currently being used by pod processes
- **Pod Memory Usage**: Current memory consumption per pod including cache and buffers

### CPU Metrics
- **Pod CPU Usage**: Real-time CPU utilization percentage for each pod

### Network Metrics
- **Pod Network I/O**: Incoming and outgoing network traffic showing receive and transmit rates

### Filesystem Metrics
- **Pod Filesystem Usage**: Storage consumption by pod containers and volumes

### Pod Status Metrics
- **Pod Restarts**: Number of container restarts within pods, indicating stability and health issues

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **k8s_cluster_name**: Filter by Kubernetes cluster name
- **k8s_namespace_name**: Filter by specific namespace
- **k8s_pod_name**: Filter by specific pod names (supports multi-select)
- **k8s_container_name**: Filter by container names within pods
