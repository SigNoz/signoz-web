## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential Kubernetes pod metrics to help you:

- **Monitor Pod Performance**: Track CPU and memory usage for individual pods
- **Resource Optimization**: Analyze resource consumption patterns across pods
- **Network Activity**: Monitor network I/O and traffic patterns per pod
- **Disk Performance**: Track disk I/O operations and throughput
- **Pod Health**: Identify performance bottlenecks and resource constraints

## Metrics Included

### CPU Metrics
- **Pod CPU Usage**: Real-time CPU utilization percentage for each pod
- **CPU Throttling**: Monitor CPU throttling events when pods exceed limits
- **CPU Requests vs Usage**: Compare requested CPU with actual consumption
- **CPU Usage Trends**: Historical CPU usage patterns for capacity planning

### Memory Metrics
- **Memory Usage**: Current memory consumption per pod
- **Memory Working Set**: Memory actively being used by pod processes
- **Memory RSS**: Resident set size memory usage
- **Memory Cache**: Cached memory utilization by pods
- **Memory Limits vs Usage**: Compare memory limits with actual consumption

### Disk I/O Metrics
- **Disk Read/Write Operations**: IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)
- **Disk Read/Write Throughput**: Data transfer rates in bytes per second
- **Disk Usage**: Storage consumption by pod containers
- **Volume Mount Performance**: Performance metrics for mounted volumes

### Network Metrics
- **Network Receive/Transmit**: Incoming and outgoing network traffic
- **Network Packet Rates**: Packets received and transmitted per second
- **Network Errors**: Network error rates and dropped packets
- **Pod-to-Pod Communication**: Inter-pod network traffic patterns

### Pod Status Metrics
- **Pod Phase**: Current pod lifecycle phase (Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed)
- **Container Restart Count**: Number of container restarts within pods
- **Pod Ready Status**: Readiness probe success/failure rates
- **Container Status**: Individual container health within pods

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **k8s_cluster_name**: Filter by Kubernetes cluster name
- **k8s_namespace_name**: Filter by specific namespace
- **k8s_pod_name**: Filter by specific pod names (supports multi-select)
- **k8s_container_name**: Filter by container names within pods
