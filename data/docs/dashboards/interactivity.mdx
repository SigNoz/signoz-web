title: Interactivity in Dashboards
---

Dashboards in SigNoz not only display charts and metrics, but also allow you to **interact with the data directly**.  
Panels created using the **Query Builder** include a context menu and click actions that let you drill deeper, apply filters, or navigate to related logs, traces, or metrics.

These interactive features make dashboards a powerful tool for root cause analysis, helping you move from high-level trends to detailed records with just a few clicks.
