**Cross Filtering** lets you use clicked data in a panel to update or create **dashboard variables**.  
When you click on a service, pod, or trace ID, the panel’s **context menu** includes a **Dashboard Variables** option.  
From here, the following actions are available:  

- **Set** – Assign the clicked value to an existing dashboard variable.  
- **Unset** – Remove the value from an existing dashboard variable.  
- **Create var** – Add a new **dynamic dashboard variable** using the clicked field. By default, no panels are configured to use a newly created variable, but you can configure panels later to reference it.  

If the clicked field already has a dynamic variable, you’ll see **Set/Unset**. Otherwise, the option will be **Create var**.  
Panels that use the updated variable will automatically refresh.

## Why use it
- **On-the-fly filtering**: Narrow scope instantly without editing queries.
- **Dynamic exploration**: Create new variables directly from clicked data.
- **Flexible workflows**: Set, unset, or create variables depending on your analysis needs.
