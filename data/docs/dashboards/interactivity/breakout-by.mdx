The **Breakout by** option allows you to **drill deeper into aggregated data** by regrouping it with another attribute.  
Instead of building a new query from scratch, you can click on a datapoint or table cell and break it down further to uncover patterns and anomalies.  

---

## How it works
1. Click on a chart datapoint, bar segment, or table cell.  
2. From the context menu, select **Breakout by...**.  
3. Choose an attribute from the list (for example, `k8s.pod.name` or `host.name`).  
4. The panel is updated in place to show the new breakdown:  
   - Existing filters, time range, and dashboard variables are preserved.  
   - The **selected data is applied as a filter** so the new breakdown focuses only on that slice.  
   - The chosen attribute becomes the **new group by dimension** (it replaces the previous grouping).  

This lets you move from a broad overview to more granular insights step by step.

## Example
In the example below, a panel showing **CPU Usage by Host** can be further analyzed by selecting **Breakout by â†’ k8s.pod.name**.  
This reveals which pods inside the host are contributing most to CPU usage.

## Why use it
- **Anomaly detection:** Spot which service, pod, or endpoint is driving unusual behavior.  
- **Layered exploration:** Start broad (by service) and go deeper (by pod, endpoint, or trace attribute).  
- **Faster debugging:** Explore data without manually editing queries.
