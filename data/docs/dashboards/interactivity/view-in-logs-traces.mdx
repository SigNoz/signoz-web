title: View in Logs/Traces
---

The **View in Logs/Traces** option allows you to go beyond aggregated charts and tables by opening the **underlying raw signal data**.  
This helps not only in viewing the exact records behind a metric or trace but also in **correlating across signals** for deeper debugging.  

---

## How it works
1. Click on a datapoint in a chart or a value in a table.  
2. A context menu will appear with options including **View in Logs** and **View in Traces**.  
3. When you select one of these options:
   - The current **filters**, **time range**, and **group-by context** are preserved.  
   - SigNoz opens the corresponding **Explorer view** (Logs or Traces).  
   - You immediately see the subset of records that contributed to the clicked datapoint.  

This ensures that you can move seamlessly from **high-level aggregates** to **detailed records** without needing to rebuild queries.

## Example
In the example below, a **CPU Usage by Host** metrics panel shows an anomaly.  
By right-clicking on the datapoint, you can select **View in Logs** or **View in Traces** from the context menu.

This workflow shortens the gap between **observing anomalies** and **finding their root cause** by connecting metrics, traces, and logs in one flow.
