The **Filter in Tables** option allows you to quickly narrow results by applying filters directly from table cells.  
Instead of editing the query manually, you can click on a group-by value in a table and add conditions on the fly.  

---

## How it works
1. Open a **Table panel** with a grouped query (for example, `COUNT(*) BY service.name`).  
2. Click on a cell in a **group-by column**.

</figure>


3. From the context menu, select **Filter by...**.  
4. Choose an operator based on the field type:  
   - **String**: `=` or `!=`  
   - **Number**: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`  
   - **Boolean**: `is true`, `is false`  
5. Enter or confirm the filter value.  
6. The table refreshes in place with the new filter applied â€” no manual edits or page reloads needed.

## Why use it
- **Faster narrowing**: Apply filters directly from the data you are inspecting.
- **Context-aware operators**: Only valid operators for the column type are shown.
- **No query editing**: Instantly re-run the query without touching the Query Builder.
