import InstrumentationFAQ from '@/components/shared/instrumentation-faq.md'


This document contains instructions on how to set up OpenTelemetry(OTel) instrumentation in your .NET application. OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is an open-source observability framework that can help you generate and collect telemetry data - traces, metrics, and logs from your .NET application.

OpenTelemetry .NET is the language-specific implementation of OpenTelemetry in .NET.

Once the telemetry data is generated, you can configure an exporter to send the data to SigNoz for monitoring and visualization.

There are three major steps to using OpenTelemetry:

- Instrumenting your .NET application with OpenTelemetry
- Configuring the exporter to send data to SigNoz
- Validating that configuration to ensure that data is being sent as expected.

In this tutorial, we will instrument a .NET application for traces and send it to SigNoz.

## Requirements

[.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (.NET 5.0 or Later)

## Send Traces to SigNoz Cloud

Based on your application environment, you can choose the setup below to send traces to SigNoz Cloud.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="vm" label="VM" default>

Tthere are two ways to send data to SigNoz Cloud.

- [Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud](#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud)
  - [No Code Automatic Instrumentation](#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud---no-code-automatic-instrumentation-recommended) (recommended)
  - [Code Level Automatic Instrumentation](#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud---code-level-automatic-instrumentation)
- [Send traces via OTel Collector binary](#send-traces-via-otel-collector-binary) (recommended)
  - [No Code Automatic Instrumentation](#send-traces-via-otel-collector-binary---no-code-automatic-instrumentation) (recommended)
  - [Code Level Automatic Instrumentation](#send-traces-via-otel-collector-binary---code-level-automatic-instrumentation)

#### Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud - No Code Automatic Instrumentation (recommended)

**Step 1: Create a shell script with the following content**
You can either create a bash script with the following content or paste this directly into your terminal after replacing `SERVICE_NAME`, `SIGNOZ_ENDPOINT` and `SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY` .

```bash
# Download the bash script
curl -sSfL https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/otel-dotnet-auto-install.sh -O

# Install core files
sh ./otel-dotnet-auto-install.sh

# Enable execution for the instrumentation script
chmod +x $HOME/.otel-dotnet-auto/instrument.sh

# Setup the instrumentation for the current shell session
. $HOME/.otel-dotnet-auto/instrument.sh

# Run your application with instrumentation
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=<SERVICE_NAME> OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=deployment.environment=staging,service.version=1.0.0 OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<SIGNOZ_ENDPOINT> OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=signoz-access-token=<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY> ./MyNetApp
```


| Variable              | Description                                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| SERVICE_NAME *      | Name you want to give to your rust application  |
| SIGNOZ_ENDPOINT  *     | This is ingestion URL which you must have got in mail after registering on SigNoz cloud  |
| SIGNOZ_ACCESS_TOKEN *  | This is Ingestion Key which you must have got in mail after registering on SigNoz cloud                                     |

If you are doing it on mac os , you will need to install `coreutils`, you can do it by using the following command

```bash
brew install coreutils
```

#### Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud - Code Level Automatic Instrumentation

**Step 1: Installing the OpenTelemetry dependency packages:**

```bash
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Runtime
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation
```

**Step 2: Adding OpenTelemetry as a service and configuring exporter options in `Program.cs`:**

In your `Program.cs` file, add OpenTelemetry as a service. Here, we are configuring these variables:

- `serviceName` - It is the name of your service.
- `otlpOptions.Endpoint` - It is the endpoint for SigNoz Cloud.
- `<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>` - You will get your ingestion key when you [sign up](https://signoz.io/teams/) for SigNoz cloud.

Here’s a sample `Program.cs` file with the configured variables.

```bash
using System.Diagnostics;
using OpenTelemetry.Exporter;
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure OpenTelemetry with tracing and auto-start.
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .ConfigureResource(resource => 
		resource.AddService(serviceName: "sample-net-app"))
    .WithTracing(tracing => tracing
        .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
        .AddOtlpExporter(otlpOptions =>
        {
						//SigNoz Cloud Endpoint 
            otlpOptions.Endpoint = new Uri("https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443");

            otlpOptions.Protocol = OtlpExportProtocol.Grpc;
						
						//SigNoz Cloud account Ingestion key
            string headerKey = "signoz-access-token";
            string headerValue = "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>";

            string formattedHeader = $"{headerKey}={headerValue}";
            otlpOptions.Headers = formattedHeader;
        }));

var app = builder.Build();

// The index route ("/") is set up to write out the OpenTelemetry trace information on the response:
app.MapGet("/", () => $"Hello World! OpenTelemetry Trace: {Activity.Current?.Id}");

app.Run();
```

Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the ingest endpoint will vary according to this table.

| Region | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| US | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

The program uses the <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore</a> package to automatically create traces for incoming ASP.NET Core requests.

The `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Options` get or set the target to which the exporter is going to send traces. Here, we’re configuring it to send traces to the SigNoz cloud. The target must be a valid Uri with the scheme (`http` or `https`) and host and may contain a port and a path.

This is done by configuring an OpenTelemetry <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/docs/trace/customizing-the-sdk/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >TracerProvider</a> using extension methods and setting it to auto-start when the host is started.

</figure>


**Step 3. Running the .NET application:**

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

**Step 4: Generating some load data and checking your application in SigNoz UI**

Once your application is running, generate some traffic by interacting with it.

In the SigNoz account, open the `Services` tab. Hit the `Refresh` button on the top right corner, and your application should appear in the list of `Applications`. Ensure that you're checking data for the `time range filter` applied in the top right corner. You might have to wait for a few seconds before the data appears on SigNoz UI.

#### Send traces via OTel Collector binary - Code Level Automatic Instrumentation

**Step 1: Setting up OpenTelemetry Collector binary as an agent in your machine**

OpenTelemetry Collector binary helps to collect logs, hostmetrics, resource and infra attributes. It is recommended to install OTel Collector binary to collect and send traces to SigNoz cloud. You can correlate signals and have rich contextual data through this way.

Go to [setup OTel Collector binary](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) to install Otel Collector as agent that will collect telemetry data from your sample dotnet app and send it to SigNoz cloud.  


**Step 2: Installing the OpenTelemetry dependency packages:**

Install the following dependencies in your application. 

```bash
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Runtime
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation
```

**Step 2: Adding OpenTelemetry as a service and configuring exporter options in `Program.cs`:**

In your `Program.cs` file, add OpenTelemetry as a service. Here, we are configuring these variables:

- `serviceName` - It is the name of your service.
- `otlpOptions.Endpoint` - It is the endpoint for your OTel Collector binary agent.

Here’s a sample `Program.cs` file with the configured variables. 

```bash
using System.Diagnostics;
using OpenTelemetry.Exporter;
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure OpenTelemetry with tracing and auto-start.
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .ConfigureResource(resource => 
		resource.AddService(serviceName: "sample-net-app"))
    .WithTracing(tracing => tracing
        .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
        .AddOtlpExporter(otlpOptions =>
        {
            otlpOptions.Endpoint = new Uri("http://localhost:4317");

            otlpOptions.Protocol = OtlpExportProtocol.Grpc;
        }));

var app = builder.Build();

//The index route ("/") is set up to write out the OpenTelemetry trace information on the response:
app.MapGet("/", () => $"Hello World! OpenTelemetry Trace: {Activity.Current?.Id}");

app.Run();
```


The program uses the <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore</a> package to automatically create traces for incoming ASP.NET Core requests.

The `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Options` get or set the target to which the exporter is going to send traces. Here, we’re configuring it to send traces to the OTel collector agent. The target must be a valid Uri with the scheme (`http` or `https`) and host and may contain a port and a path.

This is done by configuring an OpenTelemetry <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/docs/trace/customizing-the-sdk/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >TracerProvider</a> using extension methods and setting it to auto-start when the host is started.



**Step 4. Running the .NET application:**

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

**Step 5: Generating some load data and checking your application in SigNoz UI**

After the Otel collector is all set and running, and your too application is running, generate some traffic by interacting with it.

In the SigNoz account, open the `Services` tab. Hit the `Refresh` button on the top right corner, and your application should appear in the list of `Applications`. Ensure that you're checking data for the `time range filter` applied in the top right corner. You might have to wait for a few seconds before the data appears on SigNoz UI.

For .NET application deployed on Kubernetes, you need to install OTel Collector agent in your k8s infra to collect and send traces to SigNoz Cloud. You can find the instructions to install OTel Collector agent [here](/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/).

Once you have set up OTel Collector agent, you can proceed with OpenTelemetry .NET instrumentation by following either of the two:

1. [No Code Automatic Instrumentation](#no-code-automatic-instrumentation-recommended) (recommended)
2. [Code Level Automatic Instrumentation](#code-level-automatic-instrumentation)

### Send traces via OTel Collector binary

#### Send traces via OTel Collector binary - No Code Automatic Instrumentation

**Step 1: Setting up OpenTelemetry Collector binary as an agent in your machine**

OpenTelemetry Collector binary helps to collect logs, hostmetrics, resource and infra attributes. It is recommended to install OTel Collector binary to collect and send traces to SigNoz cloud. You can correlate signals and have rich contextual data through this way.


Go to [setup OTel Collector binary](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) to install Otel Collector as agent that will collect telemetry data from your sample dotnet app and send it to SigNoz cloud.  


**Step 2: Download installation scripts**

#### Send traces via OTel Collector binary - Code Level Automatic Instrumentation

**Step 1: Setting up OpenTelemetry Collector binary as an agent in your machine**

OpenTelemetry Collector binary helps to collect logs, hostmetrics, resource and infra attributes. It is recommended to install OTel Collector binary to collect and send traces to SigNoz cloud. You can correlate signals and have rich contextual data through this way.

Go to [setup OTel Collector binary](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) to install Otel Collector as agent that will collect telemetry data from your sample dotnet app and send it to SigNoz cloud.  


**Step 2: Installing the OpenTelemetry dependency packages:**

Install the following dependencies in your application. 

```bash
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Runtime
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation
```

**Step 2: Adding OpenTelemetry as a service and configuring exporter options in `Program.cs`:**

In your `Program.cs` file, add OpenTelemetry as a service. Here, we are configuring these variables:

- `serviceName` - It is the name of your service.
- `otlpOptions.Endpoint` - It is the endpoint for your OTel Collector binary agent.

Here’s a sample `Program.cs` file with the configured variables. 

```bash
using System.Diagnostics;
using OpenTelemetry.Exporter;
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure OpenTelemetry with tracing and auto-start.
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .ConfigureResource(resource => 
		resource.AddService(serviceName: "sample-net-app"))
    .WithTracing(tracing => tracing
        .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
        .AddOtlpExporter(otlpOptions =>
        {
            otlpOptions.Endpoint = new Uri("http://localhost:4317");

            otlpOptions.Protocol = OtlpExportProtocol.Grpc;
        }));

var app = builder.Build();

//The index route ("/") is set up to write out the OpenTelemetry trace information on the response:
app.MapGet("/", () => $"Hello World! OpenTelemetry Trace: {Activity.Current?.Id}");

app.Run();
```


The program uses the <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore</a> package to automatically create traces for incoming ASP.NET Core requests.

The `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Options` get or set the target to which the exporter is going to send traces. Here, we’re configuring it to send traces to the OTel collector agent. The target must be a valid Uri with the scheme (`http` or `https`) and host and may contain a port and a path.

This is done by configuring an OpenTelemetry <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/docs/trace/customizing-the-sdk/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >TracerProvider</a> using extension methods and setting it to auto-start when the host is started.



**Step 4. Running the .NET application:**

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

**Step 5: Generating some load data and checking your application in SigNoz UI**

After the Otel collector is all set and running, and your too application is running, generate some traffic by interacting with it.

In the SigNoz account, open the `Services` tab. Hit the `Refresh` button on the top right corner, and your application should appear in the list of `Applications`. Ensure that you're checking data for the `time range filter` applied in the top right corner. You might have to wait for a few seconds before the data appears on SigNoz UI.

## Troubleshooting

The console exporter prints data to the Console window. You can use it to verify if the instrumentation is properly set up or not.

Below are the steps on how to use the console exporter:

**Step 1. Adding the OpenTelemetry console exporter package:**

```bash
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console 
```

**Step 2. Adding the console exporter method:**

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;
using OpenTelemetry.Exporter;
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure OpenTelemetry with tracing and auto-start.
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .ConfigureResource(resource => 
		resource.AddService(serviceName: "sample-net-app"))
    .WithTracing(tracing => tracing
        .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
        .AddOtlpExporter(otlpOptions =>
        {
						//SigNoz Cloud Endpoint 
            otlpOptions.Endpoint = new Uri("https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443");

            otlpOptions.Protocol = OtlpExportProtocol.Grpc;
						
						//SigNoz Cloud account Ingestion key
            string headerKey = "signoz-access-token";
            string headerValue = "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>";

            string formattedHeader = $"{headerKey}={headerValue}";
            otlpOptions.Headers = formattedHeader;
        })
				.AddConsoleExporter());

var app = builder.Build();

//The index route ("/") is set up to write out the OpenTelemetry trace information on the response:
app.MapGet("/", () => $"Hello World! OpenTelemetry Trace: {Activity.Current?.Id}");

app.Run();
```

Monitor the application on the console. You will be able to see the trace output as below:

```bash
