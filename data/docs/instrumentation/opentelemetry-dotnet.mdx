This document contains instructions on how to set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation in your .NET applications and view your application traces in SigNoz.

{/* This document contains instructions on how to set up OpenTelemetry(OTel) instrumentation in your .NET application.  */}
{/* OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is an open-source observability framework that can help you generate and collect telemetry data - traces, metrics, and logs from your .NET application. */}
{/* 
OpenTelemetry .NET is the language-specific implementation of OpenTelemetry in .NET.

Once the telemetry data is generated, you can configure an exporter to send the data to SigNoz for monitoring and visualization.

There are three major steps to using OpenTelemetry:

- Instrumenting your .NET application with OpenTelemetry
- Configuring the exporter to send data to SigNoz
- Validating that configuration to ensure that data is being sent as expected.

In this tutorial, we will instrument a .NET application for traces and send it to SigNoz. */}

## Requirements

[.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (.NET 5.0 or Later)

## Send Traces to SigNoz Cloud

Based on your application environment, you can choose the setup below to send traces to SigNoz Cloud.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="vm" label="VM" default>

There are two ways to send data to SigNoz Cloud.

- Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud
  - [No Code Automatic Instrumentation](#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud---no-code-automatic-instrumentation-recommended) (recommended)
  - [Code Level Automatic Instrumentation](#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud---code-level-automatic-instrumentation)
- Send traces via OTel Collector binary (recommended)
  - [No Code Automatic Instrumentation](#send-traces-via-otel-collector-binary---no-code-automatic-instrumentation) (recommended)
  - [Code Level Automatic Instrumentation](#send-traces-via-otel-collector-binary---code-level-automatic-instrumentation)

#### Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud - No Code Automatic Instrumentation (recommended)

**Step 1: Create a shell script with the following content**

```bash
# Download the bash script
curl -sSfL https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/otel-dotnet-auto-install.sh -O

# Install core files
sh ./otel-dotnet-auto-install.sh

# Enable execution for the instrumentation script
chmod +x $HOME/.otel-dotnet-auto/instrument.sh

# Setup the instrumentation for the current shell session

```
- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- `<service_name>` is name of your service

<Admonition>
If you are doing it on mac os , you will need to install `coreutils`, you can do it by using the following command

```bash
brew install coreutils
```
</Admonition>


#### Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud - Code Level Automatic Instrumentation

**Step 1: Installing the OpenTelemetry dependency packages:**

```bash
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Runtime
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation
```

**Step 2: Adding OpenTelemetry as a service and configuring exporter options in `Program.cs`:**

In your `Program.cs` file, add OpenTelemetry as a service. Here, we are configuring these variables:

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- `<service_name>` is name of your service

Here’s a sample `Program.cs` file with the configured variables.

```bash
using System.Diagnostics;
using OpenTelemetry.Exporter;
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure OpenTelemetry with tracing and auto-start.
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .ConfigureResource(resource => 
		resource.AddService(serviceName: "sample-net-app"))
    .WithTracing(tracing => tracing
        .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
        .AddOtlpExporter(otlpOptions =>
        {
						//SigNoz Cloud Endpoint 
            otlpOptions.Endpoint = new Uri("https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443");

            otlpOptions.Protocol = OtlpExportProtocol.Grpc;
						
						//SigNoz Cloud account Ingestion key
            string headerKey = "signoz-ingestion-key";
            string headerValue = "<your-ingestion-key>";

            string formattedHeader = $"{headerKey}={headerValue}";
            otlpOptions.Headers = formattedHeader;
        }));

var app = builder.Build();

// The index route ("/") is set up to write out the OpenTelemetry trace information on the response:
app.MapGet("/", () => $"Hello World! OpenTelemetry Trace: {Activity.Current?.Id}");

app.Run();
```

The program uses the <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore</a> package to automatically create traces for incoming ASP.NET Core requests.

The `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Options` get or set the target to which the exporter is going to send traces. Here, we’re configuring it to send traces to the SigNoz cloud. The target must be a valid Uri with the scheme (`http` or `https`) and host and may contain a port and a path.

This is done by configuring an OpenTelemetry <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/docs/trace/customizing-the-sdk/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >TracerProvider</a> using extension methods and setting it to auto-start when the host is started.

</figure> */}


**Step 3. Running the .NET application:**

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

**Step 4: Generating some load data and checking your application in SigNoz UI**

Once your application is running, generate some traffic by interacting with it.

In the SigNoz account, open the `Services` tab. Hit the `Refresh` button on the top right corner, and your application should appear in the list of `Applications`. Ensure that you're checking data for the `time range filter` applied in the top right corner. You might have to wait for a few seconds before the data appears on SigNoz UI.

#### Send traces via OTel Collector binary - Code Level Automatic Instrumentation

**Step 1: Setting up OpenTelemetry Collector binary as an agent in your machine**

OpenTelemetry Collector binary helps to collect logs, hostmetrics, resource and infra attributes. It is recommended to install OTel Collector binary to collect and send traces to SigNoz cloud. You can correlate signals and have rich contextual data through this way.

Go to [setup OTel Collector binary](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) to install Otel Collector as agent that will collect telemetry data from your sample dotnet app and send it to SigNoz cloud.  


**Step 2: Installing the OpenTelemetry dependency packages:**

Install the following dependencies in your application. 

```bash
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Runtime
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation
```

**Step 2: Adding OpenTelemetry as a service and configuring exporter options in `Program.cs`:**

In your `Program.cs` file, add OpenTelemetry as a service. Here, we are configuring these variables:

- `serviceName` - It is the name of your service.
- `otlpOptions.Endpoint` - It is the endpoint for your OTel Collector binary agent.

Here’s a sample `Program.cs` file with the configured variables. 

```bash
using System.Diagnostics;
using OpenTelemetry.Exporter;
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure OpenTelemetry with tracing and auto-start.
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .ConfigureResource(resource => 
		resource.AddService(serviceName: "sample-net-app"))
    .WithTracing(tracing => tracing
        .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
        .AddOtlpExporter(otlpOptions =>
        {
            otlpOptions.Endpoint = new Uri("http://localhost:4317");

            otlpOptions.Protocol = OtlpExportProtocol.Grpc;
        }));

var app = builder.Build();

//The index route ("/") is set up to write out the OpenTelemetry trace information on the response:
app.MapGet("/", () => $"Hello World! OpenTelemetry Trace: {Activity.Current?.Id}");

app.Run();
```


The program uses the <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore</a> package to automatically create traces for incoming ASP.NET Core requests.

The `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Options` get or set the target to which the exporter is going to send traces. Here, we’re configuring it to send traces to the OTel collector agent. The target must be a valid Uri with the scheme (`http` or `https`) and host and may contain a port and a path.

This is done by configuring an OpenTelemetry <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/docs/trace/customizing-the-sdk/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >TracerProvider</a> using extension methods and setting it to auto-start when the host is started.



**Step 4. Running the .NET application:**

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

**Step 5: Generating some load data and checking your application in SigNoz UI**

After the Otel collector is all set and running, and your too application is running, generate some traffic by interacting with it.

In the SigNoz account, open the `Services` tab. Hit the `Refresh` button on the top right corner, and your application should appear in the list of `Applications`. Ensure that you're checking data for the `time range filter` applied in the top right corner. You might have to wait for a few seconds before the data appears on SigNoz UI.

<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">
You can auto-instrument sending traces from the .NET application using one of the following methods:

1. Using Kubernetes OTel Operator (recommended)
2. Using OTel Collector Agent

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="k8s-otel-operator" label="K8s OTel Operator" default>
### K8s OTel Operator Based Automatic Instrumentation (recommended)

#### Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud - Using K8s OTel Operator

For .NET application deployed on Kubernetes, you can auto-instrument the traces using Kubernetes OpenTelemetry Operator. 

An [OpenTelemetry Operator](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator) is a Kubernetes Operator that manages 
[OpenTelemetry Collectors](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-collector-complete-guide/) and auto-instrumentation of 
workloads. It basically simplifies the deployment and management of OpenTelemetry in a Kubernetes environment.

The OpenTelemetry Operator provides two Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):

- `OpenTelemetryCollector`
- `Instrumentation`

The `OpenTelemetryCollector` CRD allows you to deploy and manage OpenTelemetry Collectors in your Kubernetes cluster.

The `Instrumentation` CRD allows you to configure and inject OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation libraries into your workloads.

Here are the steps you need to follow to auto-instrument .NET application using OTel Operator:

**Step 1.** Install cert-manager

Run the following commands to apply cert manager.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.16.1/cert-manager.yaml

kubectl wait --for=condition=Available deployments/cert-manager -n cert-manager
```

**Step 2.** Install OpenTelemetry Operator

To install the operator in the existing K8s cluster, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/download/v0.116.0/opentelemetry-operator.yaml
```

Installing the OpenTelemetry Operator sets up the necessary components and configurations to enable the observability and monitoring of applications running in the cluster.

**Step 3.** Setup the OpenTelemetry Collector instance

Once the `opentelemetry-operator` has been deployed, you can proceed with the creation of the OpenTelemetry Collector (`otelcol`) instance. The OpenTelemetry Collector collects, processes, and exports telemetry data.

There are different deployment modes for the `OpenTelemetryCollector`, and you can specify them in the spec.mode section of the custom resource. The available deployment modes are:

- [Daemonset](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/)
- [Sidecar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/)
- [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)
- [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) (default mode)

The default method - the `Deployment` mode, will be used here.

To create a simple instance of the OpenTelemetry Collector, create a file `otel-collector.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml:otel-collector.yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
spec:
  mode: deployment
  config: |
    receivers:
      otlp:
        protocols:
          grpc:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
          http:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
    processors:
      batch: {}
    exporters:
      debug: {}
      otlp:
        endpoint: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443" # replace <region> with your region of SigNoz Cloud
        tls:
          insecure: false
        headers:
          "signoz-ingestion-key": "<your-ingestion-key>" # Obtain from https://{your-signoz-tenant-url}/settings/ingestion-settings
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [otlp]
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

Apply the above yaml file using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f otel-collector.yaml
```

**Step 4.** Setup the Instrumentation instance

Once the OpenTelemetry Collector instance has been deployed, the next step will be to create an instrumentation instance, which will be responsible for sending OTLP data to the OTel Collector.

Create a file `instrumentation.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml:instrumentation.yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: Instrumentation
metadata:
  name: traces-instrumentation
spec:
  exporter:
    endpoint: https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443  # replace <region> with your region of SigNoz Cloud
  env:
    - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS
      value: signoz-ingestion-key="<signoz-token>"  # Obtain from https://{your-signoz-url}/settings/ingestion-settings
    - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE
      value: "false"
  propagators:
    - tracecontext
    - baggage
    - b3
  sampler:
    type: parentbased_traceidratio
    argument: "1"
  dotnet:
    image: ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/autoinstrumentation-dotnet:latest
    env:
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
        value: http://otel-collector-collector:4318 #This is formed as: "http://<OpenTelemetryCollector name>-collector:4318"
```

Apply the above instrumentation using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f instrumentation.yaml
```

**Step 5.** Auto-instrument your .NET app with OpenTelemetry

Create `deployment.yaml` file for your .NET application as follows:

```yaml:deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dotnet-app
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dotnet-app
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: dotnet-app
      annotations:
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-dotnet: "true"
        resource.opentelemetry.io/service.name: "dotnet-app"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: dotnet-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

It is important to add the following annotation under `spec > template > metadata > annotations`:

```
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-dotnet: "true"
```

This helps in auto-instrumenting the traces from the .NET application.

Apply the deployment using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

With this, the auto-instrumentation of traces for .NET application is ready.

**Step 6.** Running the .NET application

In order to run the application on port 8080, run the following commands:

```bash
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pod -l app=<service-name> -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")  # service name is `dotnet-app` in this case.   

kubectl port-forward ${POD_NAME} 8080:8080
```

You can now access the application on port 8080.

You can validate if your application is sending traces to SigNoz cloud [here](#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces).

In case you encounter an issue where all applications do not get listed in the services section then please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-your-installation).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="otel-collector-agent" label="OTel Collector Agent">
For .NET application deployed on Kubernetes, you need to install OTel Collector agent in your k8s infra to collect and send traces to SigNoz Cloud. You can find the instructions to install OTel Collector agent [here](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/).

Once you have set up OTel Collector agent, you can proceed with OpenTelemetry .NET instrumentation by following either of the two:

1. [No Code Automatic Instrumentation](#no-code-automatic-instrumentation-recommended) (recommended)
2. [Code Level Automatic Instrumentation](#code-level-automatic-instrumentation)

```

- `<service_name>` is name of your service

### Code Level Automatic Instrumentation

**Step 1: Installing the OpenTelemetry dependency packages:**

Install the following dependencies in your application. 

```bash
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Runtime
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation
```

**Step 2: Adding OpenTelemetry as a service and configuring exporter options in `Program.cs`:**

In your `Program.cs` file, add OpenTelemetry as a service. Here, we are configuring these variables:

- `serviceName` - It is the name of your service.
- `otlpOptions.Endpoint` - It is the endpoint for your OTel Collector agent.

Here’s a sample `Program.cs` file with the configured variables. 

```bash
using System.Diagnostics;
using OpenTelemetry.Exporter;
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure OpenTelemetry with tracing and auto-start.
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .ConfigureResource(resource => 
		resource.AddService(serviceName: "sample-net-app"))
    .WithTracing(tracing => tracing
        .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
        .AddOtlpExporter(otlpOptions =>
        {
            otlpOptions.Endpoint = new Uri("http://localhost:4317");

            otlpOptions.Protocol = OtlpExportProtocol.Grpc;
        }));

var app = builder.Build();

//The index route ("/") is set up to write out the OpenTelemetry trace information on the response:
app.MapGet("/", () => $"Hello World! OpenTelemetry Trace: {Activity.Current?.Id}");

app.Run();
```


The program uses the <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore</a> package to automatically create traces for incoming ASP.NET Core requests.

The `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Options` get or set the target to which the exporter is going to send traces. Here, we’re configuring it to send traces to the OTel Collector agent. The target must be a valid Uri with the scheme (`http` or `https`) and host and may contain a port and a path.

**Step 4. Running the .NET application:**

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

**Step 5: Generating some load data and checking your application in SigNoz UI**

After the Otel collector is all set and running, and your too application is running, generate some traffic by interacting with it.

In the SigNoz account, open the `Services` tab. Hit the `Refresh` button on the top right corner, and your application should appear in the list of `Applications`. Ensure that you're checking data for the `time range filter` applied in the top right corner. You might have to wait for a few seconds before the data appears on SigNoz UI.

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- `<service_name>` is name of your service
- Replace `dotnet run` with the run command of your application

#### Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud - Code Level Automatic Instrumentation

**Step 1: Installing the OpenTelemetry dependency packages:**

```bash
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Runtime
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation
```

**Step 2: Adding OpenTelemetry as a service and configuring exporter options in `Program.cs`:**

In your `Program.cs` file, add OpenTelemetry as a service. Here, we are configuring these variables:

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- `<service_name>` is name of your service

Here’s a sample `Program.cs` file with the configured variables.

```bash
using System.Diagnostics;
using OpenTelemetry.Exporter;
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure OpenTelemetry with tracing and auto-start.
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .ConfigureResource(resource => 
		resource.AddService(serviceName: "sample-net-app"))
    .WithTracing(tracing => tracing
        .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
        .AddOtlpExporter(otlpOptions =>
        {
						//SigNoz Cloud Endpoint 
            otlpOptions.Endpoint = new Uri("https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443");

            otlpOptions.Protocol = OtlpExportProtocol.Grpc;
						
						//SigNoz Cloud account Ingestion key
            string headerKey = "signoz-ingestion-key";
            string headerValue = "<your-ingestion-key>";

            string formattedHeader = $"{headerKey}={headerValue}";
            otlpOptions.Headers = formattedHeader;
        }));

var app = builder.Build();

// The index route ("/") is set up to write out the OpenTelemetry trace information on the response:
app.MapGet("/", () => $"Hello World! OpenTelemetry Trace: {Activity.Current?.Id}");

app.Run();
```

The program uses the <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore</a> package to automatically create traces for incoming ASP.NET Core requests.

The `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Options` get or set the target to which the exporter is going to send traces. Here, we’re configuring it to send traces to the SigNoz cloud. The target must be a valid Uri with the scheme (`http` or `https`) and host and may contain a port and a path.

This is done by configuring an OpenTelemetry <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/docs/trace/customizing-the-sdk/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >TracerProvider</a> using extension methods and setting it to auto-start when the host is started.

**Step 3. Running the .NET application:**

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

**Step 4: Generating some load data and checking your application in SigNoz UI**

Once your application is running, generate some traffic by interacting with it.

In the SigNoz account, open the `Services` tab. Hit the `Refresh` button on the top right corner, and your application should appear in the list of `Applications`. Ensure that you're checking data for the `time range filter` applied in the top right corner. You might have to wait for a few seconds before the data appears on SigNoz UI.

#### Send traces via OTel Collector binary - No Code Automatic Instrumentation

**Step 1: Setting up OpenTelemetry Collector binary as an agent in your machine**

OpenTelemetry Collector binary helps to collect logs, hostmetrics, resource and infra attributes. It is recommended to install OTel Collector binary to collect and send traces to SigNoz cloud. You can correlate signals and have rich contextual data through this way.


Go to [setup OTel Collector binary](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) to install Otel Collector as agent that will collect telemetry data from your sample dotnet app and send it to SigNoz cloud.  


**Step 2: Download installation scripts**

```powershell
$module_url = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/OpenTelemetry.DotNet.Auto.psm1"
$download_path = Join-Path $env:temp "OpenTelemetry.DotNet.Auto.psm1"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $module_url -OutFile $download_path -UseBasicParsing
```

**Step 3: Execute following script to download automatic instrumentation for your development environment**

```powershell
Import-Module $download_path
Install-OpenTelemetryCore
```

**Step 4: Set variables and execute auto instrumentation**

```powershell
$env:OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER="otlp"
$env:OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4318/v1/traces"
$env:OTEL_DOTNET_AUTO_TRACES_CONSOLE_EXPORTER_ENABLED="true"
$env:OTEL_DOTNET_AUTO_LOGS_CONSOLE_EXPORTER_ENABLED="true"
Register-OpenTelemetryForCurrentSession -OTelServiceName "<service_name>"
dotnet run
```

- `<service_name>` is name of your service


replace `dotnet run` with the run command of your application

**Step 2: Installing the OpenTelemetry dependency packages:**

Install the following dependencies in your application. 

```bash
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Runtime
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore 
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation
```

**Step 2: Adding OpenTelemetry as a service and configuring exporter options in `Program.cs`:**

In your `Program.cs` file, add OpenTelemetry as a service. Here, we are configuring these variables:

- `serviceName` - It is the name of your service.
- `otlpOptions.Endpoint` - It is the endpoint for your OTel Collector binary agent.

Here’s a sample `Program.cs` file with the configured variables. 

```bash
using System.Diagnostics;
using OpenTelemetry.Exporter;
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure OpenTelemetry with tracing and auto-start.
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .ConfigureResource(resource => 
		resource.AddService(serviceName: "sample-net-app"))
    .WithTracing(tracing => tracing
        .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
        .AddOtlpExporter(otlpOptions =>
        {
            otlpOptions.Endpoint = new Uri("http://localhost:4317");

            otlpOptions.Protocol = OtlpExportProtocol.Grpc;
        }));

var app = builder.Build();

//The index route ("/") is set up to write out the OpenTelemetry trace information on the response:
app.MapGet("/", () => $"Hello World! OpenTelemetry Trace: {Activity.Current?.Id}");

app.Run();
```


The program uses the <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore</a> package to automatically create traces for incoming ASP.NET Core requests.

**Step 4. Running the .NET application:**

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

**Step 5: Generating some load data and checking your application in SigNoz UI**

After the Otel collector is all set and running, and your too application is running, generate some traffic by interacting with it.

In the SigNoz account, open the `Services` tab. Hit the `Refresh` button on the top right corner, and your application should appear in the list of `Applications`. Ensure that you're checking data for the `time range filter` applied in the top right corner. You might have to wait for a few seconds before the data appears on SigNoz UI.

## Troubleshooting

The console exporter prints data to the Console window. You can use it to verify if the instrumentation is properly set up or not.

Below are the steps on how to use the console exporter:

**Step 1. Adding the OpenTelemetry console exporter package:**

```bash
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console 
```

**Step 2. Adding the console exporter method:**

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;
using OpenTelemetry.Exporter;
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure OpenTelemetry with tracing and auto-start.
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .ConfigureResource(resource => 
		resource.AddService(serviceName: "sample-net-app"))
    .WithTracing(tracing => tracing
        .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
        .AddOtlpExporter(otlpOptions =>
        {
						//SigNoz Cloud Endpoint 
            otlpOptions.Endpoint = new Uri("https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443");

            otlpOptions.Protocol = OtlpExportProtocol.Grpc;
						
						//SigNoz Cloud account Ingestion key
            string headerKey = "signoz-ingestion-key";
            string headerValue = "<your-ingestion-key>";

            string formattedHeader = $"{headerKey}={headerValue}";
            otlpOptions.Headers = formattedHeader;
        })
				.AddConsoleExporter());

var app = builder.Build();

//The index route ("/") is set up to write out the OpenTelemetry trace information on the response:
app.MapGet("/", () => $"Hello World! OpenTelemetry Trace: {Activity.Current?.Id}");

app.Run();
```

Monitor the application on the console. You will be able to see the trace output as below:

```bash
