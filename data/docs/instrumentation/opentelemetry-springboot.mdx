This document contains instructions on how to set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation in your Spring Boot applications and view your application traces in SigNoz.

{/* This document contains instructions on how to set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation in your Spring Boot applications.  */}
{/* OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is an open source observability framework that can help you generate and collect telemetry data - traces, metrics, and logs from your Spring Boot application. */}
{/* 
OpenTelemetry Java is the language-specific implementation of OpenTelemetry in Java that can be used to instrument Spring Boot applications.

Once the telemetry data is collected, you can configure an exporter to send the data to SigNoz.

There are three major steps to using OpenTelemetry:

- Instrumenting your Spring Boot application with OpenTelemetry
- Configuring exporter to send data to SigNoz
- Validating that configuration to ensure that data is being sent as expected.

{/* There are two types of application instrumentation:

- **Auto Instrumentation**<br></br>
A completely automatic and out of box experience, with minimal code changes. For your Spring Boot application, we recommend getting started with auto instrumentation.

- **Manual Instrumentation**<br></br>
It involves writing instrumentation using OpenTelemetry SDK and API manually. You would need to get a handle to an instance of the `OpenTelemetry` interface, acquire a tracer, and create spans manually.

Letâ€™s understand how to download, install, and run OpenTelemetry in a Spring Boot application. */}


## Requirements

Java 8 or higher

## Send Traces to SigNoz Cloud

OpenTelemetry provides a handy Java JAR agent that can be attached to any Java 8+ application and dynamically injects bytecode to capture telemetry from a number of popular libraries and frameworks.

Based on your application environment, you can choose the setup below to send traces to SigNoz Cloud.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="vm" label="VM" default>

From VMs, there are two ways to send data to SigNoz Cloud.

- [Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud](#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud)
- [Send traces via OTel Collector binary](#send-traces-via-otel-collector-binary) (recommended)

#### Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud
OpenTelemetry Java agent can send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud.
  
**Step 1.** Download otel java binary agent

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
```

**Step 2.** Run your application

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name> \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<your-ingestion-key>" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443 \
java -javaagent:$PWD/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar -jar <my-app>.jar
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- `<service_name>` is name of your service

In case you encounter an issue where all applications do not get listed in the services section then please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-your-installation).

---

#### Send traces via OTel Collector binary

**Step 1.** Install OTel Collector binary<br></br>

OTel Collector binary helps to collect logs, hostmetrics, resource and infra attributes.

You can find instructions to install OTel Collector binary [here](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) in your VM.

**Step 2.** Download OTel java binary agent<br></br>
```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
```

**Step 3.** Run your application<br></br>

```bash
java -javaagent:$PWD/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar -jar <myapp>.jar
```

- `<myapp>` is the name of your application jar file
- In case you download `opentelemetry-javaagent.jar` file in different directory than that of the project, replace `$PWD` with the path of the otel jar file.

In case you encounter an issue where all applications do not get listed in the services section then please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-your-installation).
  
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">

You can auto-instrument sending traces from Java Springboot application using one of the following methods:

1. Using Kubernetes OTel Operator (recommended)
2. Using OTel Collector Agent

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="k8s-otel-operator" label="K8s OTel Operator" default>

For Java Springboot application deployed on Kubernetes, you can auto-instrument the traces using Kubernetes OpenTelemetry Operator. 

An [OpenTelemetry Operator](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator) is a Kubernetes Operator that manages 
[OpenTelemetry Collectors](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-collector-complete-guide/) and auto-instrumentation of 
workloads. It basically simplifies the deployment and management of OpenTelemetry in a Kubernetes environment.

The OpenTelemetry Operator provides two Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):

- `OpenTelemetryCollector`
- `Instrumentation`

The `OpenTelemetryCollector` CRD allows you to deploy and manage OpenTelemetry Collectors in your Kubernetes cluster.

The `Instrumentation` CRD allows you to configure and inject OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation libraries into your workloads.

Here are the steps you need to follow to auto-instrument Springboot application using OTel Operator:

#### Step 1: Install cert-manager

Run the following commands to apply cert manager.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.16.1/cert-manager.yaml

kubectl wait --for=condition=Available deployments/cert-manager -n cert-manager
```

#### Step 2: Install OpenTelemetry Operator

To install the operator in the existing K8s cluster, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/download/v0.116.0/opentelemetry-operator.yaml
```

Installing the OpenTelemetry Operator sets up the necessary components and configurations to enable the observability and monitoring of applications running in the cluster.

#### Step 3: Setup the OpenTelemetry Collector instance

Once the `opentelemetry-operator` has been deployed, you can proceed with the creation of the OpenTelemetry Collector (`otelcol`) instance. The OpenTelemetry Collector collects, processes, and exports telemetry data.

There are different deployment modes for the `OpenTelemetryCollector`, and you can specify them in the spec.mode section of the custom resource. The available deployment modes are:

- [Daemonset](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/)
- [Sidecar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/)
- [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)
- [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) (default mode)

The default method - the `Deployment` mode, will be used here.

To create a simple instance of the OpenTelemetry Collector, create a file `otel-collector.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml:otel-collector.yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
spec:
  mode: deployment
  config: |
    receivers:
      otlp:
        protocols:
          grpc:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
          http:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
    processors:
      batch: {}
    exporters:
      debug: {}
      otlp:
        endpoint: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443" # replace <region> with your region of SigNoz Cloud
        tls:
          insecure: false
        headers:
          "signoz-ingestion-key": "<your-ingestion-key>" # Obtain from https://{your-signoz-tenant-url}/settings/ingestion-settings
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [otlp]
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

Apply the above yaml file using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f otel-collector.yaml
```

#### Step 4: Setup the Instrumentation instance

Once the OpenTelemetry Collector instance has been deployed, the next step will be to create an instrumentation instance, which will be responsible for sending OTLP data to the OTel Collector.

Create a file `instrumentation.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml:instrumentation.yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: Instrumentation
metadata:
  name: traces-instrumentation
spec:
  exporter:
    endpoint: https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443  # replace {region} with your region
  env:
    - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS
      value: signoz-ingestion-key="{signoz-token}"  # Obtain from https://{your-signoz-url}/settings/ingestion-settings
    - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE
      value: "false"
  propagators:
    - tracecontext
    - baggage
    - b3
  sampler:
    type: parentbased_traceidratio
    argument: "1"
  java:
    image: ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/autoinstrumentation-java:latest
```

Apply the above instrumentation using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f instrumentation.yaml
```

#### Step 5: Auto-instrument your Springboot app with OpenTelemetry

Create `deployment.yaml` file for your Springboot application as follows:

```yaml:deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: spring-petclinic
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: spring-petclinic
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: spring-petclinic
      annotations:
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: "true"
        resource.opentelemetry.io/service.name: "spring-petclinic"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: ghcr.io/pavolloffay/spring-petclinic:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

Note that we have created the above deployment file for [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/SigNoz/spring-petclinic) Java Springboot application.

It is important to add the following annotation under `spec > template > metadata > annotations`:

```
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: "true"`
```

This helps in auto-instrumenting the traces from the Java application.

Apply the deployment using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

With this, the auto-instrumentation of traces for Java Springboot application is ready.

####  Step 6: Running the Springboot application

In order to run the application on port 8080, run the following commands:

```bash
$ export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pod -l app=<service-name> -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")  # service name is `spring-petclinic` in this case.   
$ kubectl port-forward ${POD_NAME} 8080:8080
```

You can now access the application on port 8080.

You can validate if your application is sending traces to SigNoz cloud by following the instructions [here](#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="otel-collector-agent" label="OTel Collector Agent">

For Java Springboot application deployed on Kubernetes, you need to install OTel Collector agent in your k8s infra to collect and send traces to SigNoz Cloud. You can find the
instructions to install OTel Collector agent [here](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/).

Once you have set up OTel Collector agent, you can proceed with OpenTelemetry java instrumentation by following the below steps:

1. Download otel java binary<br></br>

   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
   ```

2. Run your application<br></br>
   
   ```bash
   java -javaagent:$PWD/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar -jar <myapp>.jar
   ```

   - `<myapp>` is the name of your application jar file
   - In case you download `opentelemetry-javaagent.jar` file in different directory than that of the project, replace `$PWD` with the path of the otel jar file.

3. Make sure to dockerise your application along with OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

You can validate if your application is sending traces to SigNoz cloud by following the instructions [here](#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces).

In case you encounter an issue where all applications do not get listed in the services section then please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-your-installation).

## Send Traces to Self-Hosted SigNoz

You can use OpenTelemetry Java to send your traces directly to SigNoz. OpenTelemetry provides a **handy Java JAR agent** that can be attached to any Java 8+ application and dynamically injects bytecode to capture telemetry from a number of popular libraries and frameworks. 

### Steps to auto-instrument Spring Boot applications for traces

[OpenTelemetry Java auto-instrumentation](https://signoz.io/opentelemetry/java-auto-instrumentation/) supports collecting telemetry data from a huge number of libraries and frameworks. You can check out the full list [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/docs/supported-libraries.md).

1. **Download the latest OpenTelemetry Java JAR agent**<br></br>
   Download the latest [Java JAR agent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar). You can also use the terminal to get the file using the following command:
   
   ```bash
    wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
    ```
    

2. **Enable the instrumentation agent and run your application**<br></br>
   If you run your Spring Boot application as a JAR file, run your application using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://<IP of SigNoz Backend>:4317" OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name> java -javaagent:/path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar -jar  <myapp>.jar
    ```
    
    - `<service_name>` is name of your service
    - Â `path` should be updated to the path of the downloaded Java JAR agent.
    
    
    In the above command, we are configuring the exporter to send data to SigNoz backend. By default, OpenTelemetry Java agent usesÂ [OTLP exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/exporters/otlp) configured to send data.<br></br>
    
    Two things to note about the command:<br></br>

    `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` - This is the endpoint of the machine where SigNoz is installed.

    `path/to` -  Update it to the path of your downloaded Java JAR agent.<br></br>
    
    If you have installed SigNoz on your `localhost` and your Java JAR agent is saved at `/Users/john/Downloads/`, then the final command looks like:<br></br>
    
    ```bash
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317" OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=javaApp java -javaagent:/Users/john/Downloads/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar -jar target/*.jar
    ```
    
    Hereâ€™s a handy [grid](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/troubleshoot-instrumentation/) to figure out which address to use to send data to SigNoz.
    
    You can also specify environment variables in the following way:
    
    ```bash
    java -javaagent:/path/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
        -Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://<IP of SigNoz Backend>:4317 \
        -Dotel.resource.attributes=service.name=<service_name> \
        -jar <myapp>.jar
    ```
    

<Admonition>
ðŸ’¡ Remember to allow incoming requests to port 4317 of the machine where SigNoz backend is hosted.
</Admonition>

If you want to try this instrumentation with a sample Spring Boot application, visit this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SigNoz/spring-petclinic).

In case you encounter an issue where all applications do not get listed in the services section then please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-your-installation).
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Validating instrumentation by checking for traces

With your application running, you can verify that youâ€™ve instrumented your application with OpenTelemetry correctly by confirming that tracing data is being reported to SigNoz.

To do this, you need to ensure that your application generates some data. Applications will not produce traces unless they are being interacted with, and OpenTelemetry will often buffer data before sending. So you need to interact with your application and wait for some time to see your tracing data in SigNoz.

Validate your traces in SigNoz:

1. Trigger an action in your app that generates a web request. Hit the endpoint a number of times to generate some data. Then, wait for some time.
2. In SigNoz, open theÂ `Services`Â tab. Hit theÂ `Refresh`Â button on the top right corner, and your application should appear in the list ofÂ `Applications`.
3. Go to theÂ `Traces`Â tab, and apply relevant filters to see your applicationâ€™s traces.

{/* You might see other dummy applications if youâ€™re using SigNoz for the first time. You can remove it by following the docsÂ [here](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/docker-standalone/#remove-the-sample-application). */}

    <figcaption><i>Java Application in the list of services being monitored in SigNoz</i></figcaption>
    </figure> */}


## Configuring the agent

The agent is highly configurable. You can check out all the configuration options available [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/agent-config/).

## Disabled instrumentations

Some instrumentations can produce too many spans and make traces very noisy. For this reason, the following instrumentations are disabled by default:

- `jdbc-datasource`Â which creates spans whenever theÂ `java.sql.DataSource#getConnection`Â method is called.
- `dropwizard-metrics`,Â which might create very low-quality metrics data because of the lack of label/attribute support in the Dropwizard metrics API.

To enable them, add theÂ `otel.instrumentation.<name>.enabled`Â system property:Â `-Dotel.instrumentation.jdbc-datasource.enabled=true`

{/* 
## Manual Instrumentation

For manual instrumentation of Java application, refer to the docs [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/manual/).


{/* <!-- Get up and running with OpenTelemetry in just a few quick steps! The setup process consists of two phases--getting OpenTelemetry installed and configured, and then validating that configuration to ensure that data is being sent as expected. This guide explains how to download, install, and run OpenTelemetry in Java.

We follow [OpenTelemetry java instrumentation library](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation). **We shall be exporting data in OTLP format.**

### Getting Started

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar).

This package includes the instrumentation agent as well as instrumentations for all supported libraries and all available data exporters. The package provides a completely automatic, out-of-the-box experience.

Enable the instrumentation agent using the -javaagent flag to the JVM.



### For Java applications packaged as JAR files

If you run your Java application as a JAR file, please follow the below instruction


```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://<IP of SigNoz Backend>:4317" OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<app_name> java -javaagent:/path/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar -jar  <myapp>.jar
```

where <app_name> is the name you want to set for your application. `path` should be updated to the path of downloaded Java JAR agent.

You can also specify environment variables in the following way

```bash
java -javaagent:/path/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
    -Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://<IP of SigNoz Backend>:4317 \
    -Dotel.resource.attributes=service.name=<app_name> \
    -jar <myapp>.jar
```

<Admonition>
Remember to allow incoming requests to port 4317 of machine where SigNoz backend is hosted
</Admonition>

If you want to try out SigNoz with a sample Java application, visit this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SigNoz/spring-petclinic).

 --> */}

## Troubleshooting your installation

If spans are not being reported to SigNoz, try running in debug mode by setting `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL=debug`:

The debug log level will print out the configuration information. It will also emit every span to the console, which should look something like:

```bash
Span {
  attributes: {},
  links: [],
  events: [],
  status: { code: 0 },
  endTime: [ 1597810686, 885498645 ],
  _ended: true,
  _duration: [ 0, 43333 ],
  name: 'bar',
  spanContext: {
    traceId: 'eca3cc297720bd705e734f4941bca45a',
    spanId: '891016e5f8c134ad',
    traceFlags: 1,
    traceState: undefined
  },
  parentSpanId: 'cff3a2c6bfd4bbef',
  kind: 0,
  startTime: [ 1597810686, 885455312 ],
  resource: Resource { labels: [Object] },
  instrumentationLibrary: { name: 'example', version: '*' },
  _logger: ConsoleLogger {
    debug: [Function],
    info: [Function],
    warn: [Function],
    error: [Function]
  },
  _traceParams: {
    numberOfAttributesPerSpan: 32,
    numberOfLinksPerSpan: 32,
    numberOfEventsPerSpan: 128
  },
  _spanProcessor: MultiSpanProcessor { _spanProcessors: [Array] }
},
```
