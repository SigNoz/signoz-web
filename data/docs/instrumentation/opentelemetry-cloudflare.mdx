This document explains how to instrument Cloudflare Workers with OpenTelemetry and send traces to SigNoz.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following in place before moving on to the next step:
- A Cloudflare account
- [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), the CLI tool for Cloudflare.

## Send traces to SigNoz

<Tabs entityName="plans">
<TabItem value="signoz-cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

**Step 1: Install the SDK**

Install `@microlabs/otel-cf-workers` in your [project](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/#1-create-a-new-worker-project).

```bash
npm i @microlabs/otel-cf-workers
```

for instrumenting and exporting traces from Cloudflare Workers.

**Step 2: Add Node.js Compatibility Flag**

OpenTelemetry requires the Node.js compatibility flag to be enabled at the top level of your `wrangler.toml`.

```yaml:wrangler.toml
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
```

**Step 3: Configure tracer in Cloudflare Workers project**

Navigate to the wrangler project directory, and add the following code to your `src/index.ts` file.

```javascript:index.ts
import { instrument, ResolveConfigFn } from '@microlabs/otel-cf-workers'

const handler = {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
        // your cloudflare worker code
    },
}

const config: ResolveConfigFn = (env: Env, _trigger) => {
    return {
        exporter: {
            url: 'https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443/v1/traces',
            headers: { 'signoz-access-token': '<your-ingestion-key>' },
        },
        service: { name: '<service-name>' },
    }
}

export default instrument(handler, config)
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- Replace `<service-name>` with the name of the service associated with this trace

**Step 4: Deploy the project**

Deploy the project to Cloudflare Worker.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

**Step 1: Install the SDK**

```bash
npm i @microlabs/otel-cf-workers

```javascript:index.ts
import { instrument, ResolveConfigFn } from '@microlabs/otel-cf-workers'

const handler = {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
        // your cloudflare worker code
    },
}

const config: ResolveConfigFn = (env: Env, _trigger) => {
    return {
        exporter: {
            url: 'http://localhost:4318/v1/traces'
        },
        service: { name: '<service-name>' },
    }
}

export default instrument(handler, config)
```

- Replace `<service-name>` with the name of the service associated with this trace

**Step 4: Deploy the project**

Deploy the project to Cloudflare Worker.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Visualize the traces in SigNoz

- Traces can be viewed under the `Traces` tab in the SigNoz UI.

<Figure src="/img/docs/instrumentation/cloudflare/TracesList.webp" alt="Cloudflare Traces in Traces View" caption="Cloudflare Traces in Traces View" />

- You can click on a particular `TraceID` in the `Traces` view to get the detailed view of the Cloudflare Worker as shown in the image below.

## Send logs to SigNoz

In order to push logs from Cloudflare Worker, you need the Enterprise plan. For sending Cloudflare Worker logs to SigNoz, you can 
use the cloudflare opentelemetry receiver. Refer [this page](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/cloudflarereceiver) 
for detailed instructions.
