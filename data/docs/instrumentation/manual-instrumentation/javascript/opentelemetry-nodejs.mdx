title: Manual Instrumentation in NodeJS
description: Manually instrument your NodeJS application with OpenTelemetry and send data to SigNoz
---

### Why Manual Instrumentation

Manual instrumentation allows developers to gain fine-grained control over the monitoring and observability of their applications by adding specific traces and metrics that automatic instrumentation might miss.

#### When to Use Manual Spans

- **Detailed Business Logic Tracking**: For tracing specific business processes and operations.
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: To identify and analyze performance issues in critical sections of your application.
- **Error Handling and Debugging**: For tracking and recording detailed error information and exceptions.

#### When to Use Custom Metrics

- **Performance Monitoring**: For tracking specific performance metrics like response times or processing durations.
- **Resource Utilization**: To monitor and manage resource usage, such as memory and CPU consumption.
- **Business KPIs**: For capturing key performance indicators relevant to your business logic.

### Set Up Custom Spans

#### Install Dependencies

If you haven't already, install the necessary OpenTelemetry libraries:

```bash
npm install @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/resources @opentelemetry/semantic-conventions
```

#### Acquiring a Tracer

Acquire a tracer to create spans:

```jsx
import { trace } from '@opentelemetry/api'
const tracer = trace.getTracer('your-service-name')
```

#### Adding Custom Spans

Example of adding a custom span in a function:

```jsx
async function yourFunction() {
  return tracer.startActiveSpan('your-span-name', async (span) => {
    try {
      // Start a new active span named 'your-span-name'
      span.addEvent('Event description') // Add an event with a description to the span
      span.setAttribute('attributeKey', 'attributeValue') // Set an attribute on the span
      span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.OK }) // Set the status of the span to OK
    } catch (error) {
      span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR, message: error.message }) // Set the status to ERROR if an exception occurs
      span.recordException(error) // Record the exception in the span
      throw error
    } finally {
      span.end() // End the span
    }
  })
}
```

#### Running the Application

Run your application normally, ensuring the tracing configuration is loaded first.

#### Verifying the Manual Spans

Check SigNoz for the manually created spans and verify the attributes and events are correctly logged.

For more detailed instructions with a [sample app](https://github.com/SigNoz/opentelemetry-nodejs-example), refer to the complete article in the series: [Manual Instrumentation for Traces - OpenTelemetry NodeJS](https://signoz.io/opentelemetry/add-manual-span-to-traces-nodejs/)

### Set Up Custom Metrics

#### Setup Metric Collection

Create a `telemetry.js` file and configure the `MeterProvider` with an `OTLPMetricExporter`:

```jsx
import { metrics } from '@opentelemetry/api'
import {
  MeterProvider,
  PeriodicExportingMetricReader,
  ConsoleMetricExporter,
} from '@opentelemetry/sdk-metrics'
import { Resource } from '@opentelemetry/resources'
import {
  SEMRESATTRS_SERVICE_NAME,
  SEMRESATTRS_SERVICE_VERSION,
} from '@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions'
import { OTLPMetricExporter } from '@opentelemetry/exporter-metrics-otlp-http'

// Define resource with service name
const resource = Resource.default().merge(
  new Resource({
    [SEMRESATTRS_SERVICE_NAME]: 'your-service-name',
  })
)

// Configure OTLP metrics exporter
const otlpMetricsExporter = new OTLPMetricExporter({
  url: 'http://otel-collector:4318/v1/metrics', // ensure the port is correct
})

const metricReader = new PeriodicExportingMetricReader({
  exporter: otlpMetricsExporter,

  // Default is 60000ms (60 seconds). Set to 10 seconds for demonstrative purposes only.
  exportIntervalMillis: 10000,
})

// Initialize MeterProvider
const myServiceMeterProvider = new MeterProvider({
  resource: resource,
  readers: [metricReader],
})

// Set this MeterProvider to be global to the app being instrumented.
metrics.setGlobalMeterProvider(myServiceMeterProvider)
```

- Here, `your-service-name` is the name you give to your service, which helps identify it in SigNoz. Replace `your-service-name` with a unique name that describes the service's function.
- `otel-collector` refers to the OpenTelemetry Collector endpoint where your application will send its metrics. Make sure this URL points to the correct location of your OpenTelemetry Collector instance.

#### Collect Metrics in Business Logic

Modify your business logic to measure and record metrics.

```jsx
import { performance } from 'perf_hooks'

const meter = metrics.getMeter('your-service-name')

async function yourFunction(parameter) {
  const startTime = performance.now()
  const yourMetric = meter.createHistogram('your-metric-name', {
    description: 'Description of your metric',
  })

  // Your business logic here

  const duration = performance.now() - startTime
  yourMetric.record(duration, { attributeKey: 'attributeValue' })
}
```

- Replace `your-service-name` with the name you give to your service.
- `your-metric-name` is the name you give to the metric you are creating. It should be a unique and descriptive name that reflects what the metric is measuring.
- The `Description of your metric` provides additional context about what the metric represents, helping others understand its purpose.

#### Running the Application

Run your application ensuring the telemetry configuration is loaded first.

#### Verifying and Visualizing Metrics

1. Ensure your application is running and sending metrics.
2. Use your observability platform's dashboard to visualize the metrics.
3. Create a [visualization](https://signoz.io/docs/dashboards/panel-types/histogram/) to display the recorded metrics.
