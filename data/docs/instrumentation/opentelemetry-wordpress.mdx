## Requirements

You will need the following in place before moving on to the next step:
- A self-managed WordPress site
- Permissions on the hosting server to install packages (Admin/Sudo)
- [PHP 8.0+](https://www.php.net/) / PHP 8.1+ if you want to use _Protobuf_
- [PECL](https://pecl.php.net/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) 

<Admonition type="warning" title="Note">
The instrumentation process involves performing tasks such as building the OpenTelemetry extension from source, modifying the `php.ini` file and restarting services.

## Send WordPress traces to SigNoz Cloud

The following steps demonstrate how to instrument a WordPress site running on a Linux host with OpenTelemetry and then send the traces to SigNoz Cloud.

### Step 1: Build and enable the OpenTelemetry PHP extension

Start by installing the necessary build tools. You will also need the `php-pear` (for PECL) and `php-dev` packages for building and installing the extension.
You can do this by running the following commands:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux (apt)" default>

```bash
sudo apt install gcc make autoconf
sudo apt install php-pear php-dev
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, install the OpenTelemetry PHP extension using `pecl`. Run the following command to do so:

```bash
sudo pecl install opentelemetry
```

This will download the OpenTelemetry extension and its dependencies, compile them, and install them on the server in the default _php extensions_ folder. You may want to make a note of the path where the extensions were installed if needed for the `php.ini` configuration. 

Finally, you must enable the OpenTelemetry extension. You will not be able to install the _OpenTelemetry_ extensions using composer later if it is not enabled in PHP. To do so add the following line to your `php.ini` file:

```ini
[opentelemetry]
extension=opentelemetry.so
```

<Admonition type="info">
Ensure to modify the correct `php.ini` file that is being used by PHP.
</Admonition>

Finally, verify that the extensions are enabled by running the following command:

```bash
php -m | grep opentelemetry
```

If the extensions are installed correctly, you should see `opentelemetry` in the output.  

<Admonition type="info">
If `php -m` output is empty, try restarting the web server or if you are using PHP-FPM with NGINX, try restarting the `php-fpm` service.
</Admonition>

### Step 2: Add OpenTelemetry SDK and other dependencies
In this step, you will use _Composer_ to add **OpenTelemetry SDK** and other dependencies such as the **OLTP Exporter** and the **OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation for Wordpress** package for automatic instrumentation in WordPress. 

Start by navigating to the root directory of your WordPress installation. This is usually the directory where `wp-config.php` is located.
For example, if your WordPress installation is located at `/var/www/html/wordpress`, run the following command:

```bash
cd /var/www/html/wordpress
```

Next, run the following command to initialize a new Composer project:

```bash
composer init
```

You will be prompted to enter some information about the project. You can skip most of the prompts by pressing `Enter` or `n`, but make sure to set the `name` and `description` fields. This will create a new `composer.json` file in the root directory of your WordPress installation.

Once the `composer.json` file is created, you will need to add the OpenTelemetry SDK and other dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
composer require \
    open-telemetry/sdk \
    open-telemetry/exporter-otlp \ 
    open-telemetry/opentelemetry-auto-wordpress
```

Press `y` to any prompts during the installation process. The `composer.json` file should now look something like this:

```json
{
    "name": "wordpress/opentelemtry-signoz",
    "require": {
        "open-telemetry/sdk": "^1.2",
        "open-telemetry/exporter-otlp": "^1.2",
        "symfony/http-client": "^6.4",
        "nyholm/psr7": "^1.8",
        "open-telemetry/opentelemetry-auto-wordpress": "^0.0.17"
    },
    "config": {
        "allow-plugins": {
            "php-http/discovery": true,
            "tbachert/spi": true
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Install the OpenTelemetry Collector
In this step, you will install the OpenTelemetry collector on the WordPress host. The collector will receive traces from the OpenTelemetry PHP extension and send them to SigNoz. You will configure it to use the OTLP exporter for it.

To intall the OpenTelemetry collector, run the following command:

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.125.0/otelcol_0.125.0_linux_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i otelcol_0.125.0_linux_amd64.deb
```

Verify that the collector is running with the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status otelcol
```

### Step 4: Configure PHP with OpenTelemetry settings
In this step, you will configure PHP with OpenTelemtry settings. You will also add a prepend file to initialize composer. 

Let's start with adding the following OpenTelemetry environment variables to the `php.ini` file. Choose an option based on your SigNoz setup i.e. whether you are using SigNoz Cloud or self-hosted SigNoz.

<Tabs entityName="plans">
<TabItem value="signoz-cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

Open the `php.ini` file in your favorite text editor and add the following lines:

```ini
OTEL_PHP_AUTOLOAD_ENABLED="true"
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=wordpress
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
OTEL_PROPAGATORS=baggage,tracecontext
```

<Admonition type="info">
A quick note on some of these values:
- `wordpress` is the name of the service. This is the name that will be used to identify your service in SigNoz. Replace it with a different one as needed.
- `http://localhost:4318` is the endpoint where OpenTelemetry collector is running, which in this example is the same host. Port 4318 is the default port for http protocol. 
</Admonition>

For more information on these environment variables, refer to the [OpenTelemetry PHP Configuration documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/php/sdk/#configuration).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="self-hosted-signoz" label="Self-Hosted SigNoz">

Open the `php.ini` file in your favorite text editor and add the following lines:

```ini
OTEL_PHP_AUTOLOAD_ENABLED="true"
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=wordpress
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://self-host-ip
OTEL_PROPAGATORS=baggage,tracecontext
```

<Admonition type="info">
A quick note on some of these values:
- `wordpress` is the name of the service. This is the name that will be used to identify your service in SigNoz. Replace it with a different one as needed.
- `http://self-host-ip` is where the self-hosted SigNoz instance is running.
</Admonition>

For more information on these environment variables, refer to the [OpenTelemetry PHP Configuration documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/php/sdk/#configuration).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, to add a prepend file, you will use the `auto_prepend_file` directive in `php.ini` that allows you to specify a file to be executed before any other PHP files are run. This is useful for initializing the OpenTelemetry SDK and other dependencies. Modify the `auto_prepend_file` value to point to the `vendor/autoload.php` file that was created by Composer. Write the absolute path. 
For example:

```ini
auto_prepend_file=/var/www/html/wordpress/vendor/autoload.php
```

Finally, restart the web server or PHP-FPM service to apply the changes. 


### Step 5: Verify the Service and Traces in SigNoz

Login to your SigNoz instance and navigate to the **Services** section.

You should see the service name you specified earlier, click on it to view the RED metrics.

</figure>

Make a few operations in the WordPress website to see the traces in SigNoz. You can do this by visiting different pages on your WordPress site, creating posts, or performing other actions.

Next, navigate to the **Traces** section in SigNoz to view the traces. You should see traces being generated for the operations you performed on your WordPress site.
