import InstrumentationFAQ from '@/components/shared/instrumentation-faq.md'

This document contains instructions on how to set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation in your Python applications. OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is an open source observability framework that can help you generate and collect telemetry data - traces, metrics, and logs from your Python application.

Once the telemetry data is collected, you can configure an exporter to send the data to SigNoz.

There are three major steps to using OpenTelemetry:

- Instrumenting your Python application with OpenTelemetry
- Configuring exporter to send data to SigNoz
- Validating that configuration to ensure that data is being sent as expected.

Let’s understand how to download, install, and run OpenTelemetry in Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer

## Send Traces to SigNoz Cloud

Based on your application environment, you can choose the setup below to send traces to SigNoz Cloud.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="vm" label="VM" default>

From VMs, there are two ways to send data to SigNoz Cloud.

- [Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud](#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud)
- [Send traces via OTel Collector binary](#send-traces-via-otel-collector-binary) (recommended)

#### Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud

**Step 1.** Create a virtual environment<br></br>
    
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Step 2.** Install the OpenTelemetry dependencies

```bash
pip install opentelemetry-distro==0.43b0
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==1.22.0
```

**Step 3.** Add automatic instrumentation

```bash
opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
```

**Step 4.** Run your application

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name> \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-access-token=SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
opentelemetry-instrument <your_run_command>
```

- *`<service_name>`* is the name of the service you want
- *`<your_run_command>`* can be `python3 app.py` or `flask run`
- Replace `SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY` with the api token provided by SigNoz. You can find it in the email sent by SigNoz with your cloud account details.

Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the ingest endpoint will vary according to this table.

| Region | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| US |	ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN |	ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

**Step 5.** Validate if your application is sending traces to SigNoz cloud by following the instructions [here](#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces).

In case you encounter an issue where all applications do not get listed in the services section then please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-your-signoz-installation).

---

#### Send traces via OTel Collector binary

OTel Collector binary helps to collect logs, hostmetrics, resource and infra attributes. It is recommended to install Otel Collector binary to collect and send traces to SigNoz cloud. You can correlate signals and have rich contextual data through this way.

You can find instructions to install OTel Collector binary [here](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) in your VM. Once you are done setting up your OTel Collector binary, you can follow the below steps for instrumenting your Python application.

**Step 1.** Install the OpenTelemetry dependencies

```bash
pip install opentelemetry-distro==0.43b0
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==1.22.0
```

**Step 2.** Add automatic instrumentation

```bash
opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
```

**Step 3.** To run your application and send data to collector in same VM:

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name> \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
opentelemetry-instrument <your_run_command>
```

where,

- *`<service_name>`* is the name of the service you want
- *`<your_run_command>`* can be `python3 app.py` or `flask run`

In case you have OtelCollector Agent in different VM, replace localhost:4317 with `<IP Address of the VM>:4317`.

**Step 4.** You can validate if your application is sending traces to SigNoz cloud by following the instructions [here](#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces).

In case you encounter an issue where all applications do not get listed in the services section then please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-your-signoz-installation).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">

For Python application deployed on Kubernetes, you need to install OTel Collector agent in your k8s infra to collect and send traces to SigNoz Cloud. You can find the instructions to install OTel Collector agent [here](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/).

Once you have set up OTel Collector agent, you can proceed with OpenTelemetry Python instrumentation by following the below steps:

**Step 1.** Add OpenTelemetry dependencies

In your `requirements.txt` file, add these two OpenTelemetry dependencies:

```bash
opentelemetry-distro==0.43b0
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==1.22.0
```

**Step 2.** Add automatic instrumentation

```bash
opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
```

**Step 3.** Run your application:

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name> \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
opentelemetry-instrument <your_run_command>
```

where,

- *`<service_name>`* is the name of the service you want
- *`<your_run_command>`* can be `python3 app.py` or `flask run`


**Step 4.** Dockerize your application

To dockerize your application, you **don't need to follow Step 2 and Step 3** mentioned above as they are part of the dockerfile.

To make sure that you Dockerize your application along with the OpenTelemetry instructions, update your Dockerfile like below:

```bash
...
# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
# And install OpenTelemetry packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt 

RUN opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Set environment variables for OpenTelemetry
ENV OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service-name>
ENV OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
ENV OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=signoz-access-token=<SIGNOZ-INGESTION-KEY>
ENV OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc

# Run app.py with OpenTelemetry instrumentation when the container launches
CMD ["opentelemetry-instrument", "python", "app.py"]
...
```

This updated Dockerfile instructions will install required packages from `requirements.txt`, including OpenTelemetry components. It sets the environment variable for OpenTelemetry configuration specifying the service name, OTLP exporter endpoint, and protocol. The container executes 'app.py' with OpenTelemetry tracing, exposing port 5000. 

Once you are done updating your Dockerfile, you can build and run your docker image using the commands below:

Build your docker image
```bash
docker build -t <your-image-name> .
```

Here's how you can run your docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 <your-image-name>
```

The Docker run command starts a container in detached mode (-d) and maps port 5000 of the host to port 5000 of the container. 

- *`<service-name>`* is name of your service or application
- *`<your-image-name>`* is the name of your docker image
- Replace `<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>` with the ingestion key provided by SigNoz. You can find it in the email sent by SigNoz with your cloud account details.

You can validate if your application is sending traces to SigNoz cloud by following the instructions [here](#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces).

In case you encounter an issue where all applications do not get listed in the services section then please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-your-signoz-installation).

## Send Traces to Self-Hosted SigNoz

You can use OpenTelemetry Python to send your traces directly to SigNoz. OpenTelemetry provides a handy distro in Python that can help you get started with automatic instrumentation. We recommend using it to get started quickly.

### Steps to auto-instrument Python app for traces


    <Admonition type="info">
    If you are on K8s, you should checkout [opentelemetry operators](/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-operator-usage/#opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-injection) which enable auto instrumenting Python applications very easily.
    </Admonition>

1. **Create a virtual environment**<br></br>
    
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. **Install the OpenTelemetry dependencies**<br></br>
    
    ```bash
    pip install opentelemetry-distro==0.43b0
    pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==1.22.0
    ```

    The dependencies included are briefly explained below:

    `opentelemetry-distro` - The distro provides a mechanism to automatically configure some of the more common options for users. It helps to get started with OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation quickly. 
    
    `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp` - This library provides a way to install all OTLP exporters. You will need an exporter to send the data to SigNoz.

    <Admonition>
    💡 The `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp` is a convenience wrapper package to install all OTLP exporters. Currently, it installs:
    
    - opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http
    - opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc

    - (soon) opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-json-http
    
    The `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc` package installs the gRPC exporter which depends on the `grpcio` package. The installation of `grpcio` may fail on some platforms for various reasons. If you run into such issues, or you don't want to use gRPC, you can install the HTTP exporter instead by installing the `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http` package. You need to set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` environment variable to `http/protobuf` to use the HTTP exporter.
    </Admonition>
    
3. **Add automatic instrumentation**<br></br>
     The below command inspects the dependencies of your application and installs the instrumentation packages relevant for your Python application.
    
    ```bash
    opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
    ```

    <Admonition>
     Please make sure that you have installed all the dependencies of your application before running the above command. The command will not install instrumentation for the dependencies which are not installed.
    </Admonition>

4. **Run your application**<br></br>
     
    <Admonition>
     Don’t run app in reloader/hot-reload mode as it breaks instrumentation. For example, if you use `export FLASK_ENV=development`, it enables the reloader mode which breaks OpenTelemetry instrumentation.
    </Admonition>
     
     
     To start sending data to SigNoz, use the following run command:

     ```bash
     OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name> OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://<IP of SigNoz Backend>:4317" OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc opentelemetry-instrument <your run command>
     ```

     *`<service_name>`* is the name of the service you want

     *`<your_run_command>`* can be `python3 app.py` or `flask run`

     `IP of SigNoz backend` is the IP of the machine where you installed SigNoz. If you have installed SigNoz on `localhost`, the endpoint will be `http://localhost:4317` for gRPC exporter and `http://localhost:4318` for HTTP exporter.

     Replacing these environment variables, a sample final run command will look like this:

     ```bash
     OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=python_app OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317" OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc opentelemetry-instrument python3 app.py
     ```
     
    <Admonition>
     The port numbers are 4317 and 4318 for the gRPC and HTTP exporters respectively. Remember to allow incoming requests to port **4317**/**4318** of machine where SigNoz backend is hosted.
    </Admonition>
     
    In case you encounter an issue where all applications do not get listed in the services section then please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-your-signoz-installation).

## Validating instrumentation by checking for traces

With your application running, you can verify that you’ve instrumented your application with OpenTelemetry correctly by confirming that tracing data is being reported to SigNoz.

To do this, you need to ensure that your application generates some data. Applications will not produce traces unless they are being interacted with, and OpenTelemetry will often buffer data before sending. So you need to interact with your application and wait for some time to see your tracing data in SigNoz.

Validate your traces in SigNoz:

1. Trigger an action in your app that generates a web request. Hit the endpoint a number of times to generate some data. Then, wait for some time.
2. In SigNoz, open the `Services` tab. Hit the `Refresh` button on the top right corner, and your application should appear in the list of `Applications`.
3. Go to the `Traces` tab, and apply relevant filters to see your application’s traces.

You might see other dummy applications if you’re using SigNoz for the first time. You can remove it by following the docs [here](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/docker-standalone/#remove-the-sample-application).

    </figure>


## Database Instrumentation

Make sure that the DB client library you are using has the corresponding instrumentation library, and the version of the DB client library is supported by OpenTelemetry.

### MongoDB

You can use  `opentelemetry-distro` to initialize instrumentation for your MongoDB database calls. You need to ensure that the version of your DB client library is supported by OpenTelemetry. For MongoDB, the instrumentation library is `opentelemetry-instrumentation-pymongo`.

You can check the supported versions [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).

### Redis

You can use  `opentelemetry-distro` to initialize instrumentation for your Redis database calls. You need to ensure that the version of your DB client library is supported by OpenTelemetry. For Redis, the instrumentation library is `opentelemetry-instrumentation-redis`.

You can check the supported versions [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).

### MySQL

You can use  `opentelemetry-distro` to initialize instrumentation for your MySQL database calls. You need to ensure that the version of your DB client library is supported by OpenTelemetry. For MySQL, we have two instrumentation libraries:

- opentelemetry-instrumentation-mysql
- opentelemetry-instrumentation-pymysql

You can check the supported versions [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).

### Postgres

You can use  `opentelemetry-distro` to initialize instrumentation for your PostgreSQL database calls. You need to ensure that the version of your DB client library is supported by OpenTelemetry. For Postgres, the instrumentation library is `opentelemetry-instrumentation-psycopg2`.

You can check the supported versions [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).

<Admonition>

`psycopg2-binary` is not supported by opentelemetry auto instrumentation libraries as it is not recommended for production use. Please use `psycopg2` to see DB calls also in your trace data in SigNoz

</Admonition>

## Running applications with Gunicorn, uWSGI

For application servers which are based on pre fork model like Gunicorn, uWSGI you have to add a `post_fork` hook or a `@postfork` decorator in your configuration.

Check this [documentation](https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/fork-process-model/README.html) from OpenTelemetry on how to set it up.

[Here's](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/tree/main/docs/examples/fork-process-model) a working example configured with a gunicorn server with `post_fork` hook.
  



## Troubleshooting your SigNoz installation

#### Application servers such as Uvicorn, Hypercorn, etc.

- Uvicorn with `--workers` flag is not supported. The work around for this is to use `gunicorn` with uvicorn as the worker class `gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`.
- Hypercorn is not supported. There is no workaround for this. Please follow the issue https://github.com/pgjones/hypercorn/issues/215

#### Spans are not being reported

If spans are not being reported to SigNoz, try enabling debug exporter which writes the JSON formatted trace data to the console by setting env var OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=console.

```
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=python_app OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=console opentelemetry-instrument <your run command>
```
