This document contains instructions on how to set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation in your Angular applications. OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is an open source observability framework that can help you generate and collect telemetry data - traces, metrics, and logs from your Nestjs application.


Once the telemetry data is collected, you can configure an exporter to send the data to SigNoz.

There are three major steps to using OpenTelemetry:

- Instrumenting your Angular application with OpenTelemetry
- Configuring exporter to send data to SigNoz
- Validating that configuration to ensure that data is being sent as expected.

{/* <!-- ### Why you need to instrument your frontend application ðŸ¤”

We all are familiar with instrumenting backend services but have you ever thought about instrumenting frontend applications. Let us first understand why we need to instrument frontend applications and why reliability is a priority.

- Frontend is the first and last point of the user's interaction.
- Unreliable frontend can block user's access to product in turn having a direct business impact.
- Increasing devices and platforms unlocks new user genres hence unknown and multiple points of failure.
- To examine and analyze the reliability of a new feature served as an A/B experiment.
- It works in region X but not in region Y.
- RCA on the user's complete journey inside the application. --> */}

### Instrumenting your Angular App with OpenTelemetry ðŸ› 

#### Pre-requisites

Enable CORS in the OTel Receiver. Inside `docker/clickhouse-setup/otel-collector-config.yaml` add the following CORS config. You can view the file at [SigNoz GitHub repo](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/develop/deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/otel-collector-config.yaml).

```yml
      http:
+        cors:
+          allowed_origins:
+            - https://netflix.com  # URL of your Frontend application
```

> Make sure to restart the container after making the config changes

Now let's get back to instrumenting our Angular Application. Let's start by installing a couple of dependencies.

```sh
npm i @jufab/opentelemetry-angular-interceptor && npm i @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-web @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base @opentelemetry/core @opentelemetry/semantic-conventions @opentelemetry/resources @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http @opentelemetry/exporter-zipkin @opentelemetry/propagator-b3 @opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger @opentelemetry/context-zone-peer-dep @opentelemetry/instrumentation @opentelemetry/instrumentation-document-load @opentelemetry/instrumentation-fetch @opentelemetry/instrumentation-xml-http-request @opentelemetry/propagator-aws-xray --save-dev
```

Not let's import OTel module in `app.module.ts`

```ts
import {
  OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule,
  OtelColExporterModule,
  CompositePropagatorModule,
} from '@jufab/opentelemetry-angular-interceptor';

@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    ...
    OpenTelemetryInterceptorModule.forRoot({
      commonConfig: {
        console: true, // Display trace on console (only in DEV env)
        production: false, // Send Trace with BatchSpanProcessor (true) or SimpleSpanProcessor (false)
        serviceName: 'Angular Sample App', // Service name send in trace
        probabilitySampler: '1',
      },
      otelcolConfig: {
        url: 'http://127.0.0.1:4318/v1/traces', // URL of opentelemetry collector
      },
    }),
    //Insert OtelCol exporter module
    OtelColExporterModule,
    //Insert propagator module
    CompositePropagatorModule,
  ],
  ...
})
```

This config would be enough to get you up and running. For more tweaks refer to [this](https://github.com/jufab/opentelemetry-angular-interceptor#readme) detailed documentation of the instrumentation library.
