## Overview

External API Monitoring works automatically with properly instrumented applications. This document explains the requirements needed for this feature to work.

## Setup

To enable API monitoring, make sure that your application is instrumented correctly. For details about instrumenting application for your language/framework, please refer 
[this document](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/).

For every external call, spans must include the below [attributes](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-spans/#what-are-span-attributes):

- `net.peer.name`
- `http.url`
- `http.target`

These span attributes are used to automatically derive API calls.

<Admonition>
In case of manual instrumentation, ensure that all the client to server calls are instrumented and the above attributes are added explicitly for each outbound request.
</Admonition>

## Verification

To verify that your instrumentation is correctly configured:

1. Generate some traffic that includes external API calls
2. Navigate to the External API Monitoring section in SigNoz
3. Check if your external domains appear in the list

## Troubleshooting

If your external API domains/endpoints aren't appearing in the monitoring interface:

- Check that your service is properly [instrumented](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/) and sending traces to SigNoz
- Verify that your HTTP client libraries are being instrumented
- For manual instrumentation, ensure you're adding all required attributes
- If you're using OpenTelemetry collector, review its configuration to ensure it's forwarding all attributes

## Next Steps

Once your application is properly instrumented, head to the [Overview section](https://signoz.io/docs/external-api-monitoring/overview/) to learn how to use External API Monitoring to gain insights into your external API 
dependencies.
