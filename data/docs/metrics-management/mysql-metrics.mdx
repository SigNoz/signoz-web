This document explains how to monitor MySQL database metrics using OpenTelemetry Collector and SigNoz.

## Pre-requisites

- MySQL database server running and accessible

## Setup

### Step 1: Setup OTel Collector

OpenTelemetry Collector is required to collect metrics from MySQL. Please refer to this [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) to setup the agent.

### Step 2: Configuring the MySQL receiver

You will need to configure the [MySQL receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/mysqlreceiver/README.md) for collecting MySQL metrics. The receiver collects various performance metrics from your MySQL database.

Edit the OTel Collector config file to configure the `mysql` receiver as shown below:

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  mysql:
    endpoint: <mysql-endpoint>
    username: <your-root-username>
    password: <your-root-password>
    collection_interval: 10s
    initial_delay: 10s
```

**Configuration parameters:**

- `endpoint`: MySQL server endpoint (required)
- `username`: MySQL username (required)
- `password`: MySQL password (required)


You can find more details about the MySQL receiver configuration in the [receiver documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/mysqlreceiver/README.md).

### Step 3: Configuring the pipelines

Once the receiver is configured, you need to enable it in the `pipelines` section of the OTel Collector config file:

```yaml:config.yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [mysql]
```

Now, run the OpenTelemetry collector and you should see the metrics coming in SigNoz. 

## Visualizing MySQL Metrics

Once you have configured OTel Collector to send MySQL metrics to SigNoz, you can start visualizing the metrics in the [metrics explorer](https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/metrics-explorer/).

You can also use the pre-configured [MySQL dashboard](https://signoz.io/docs/dashboards/dashboard-templates/mysql/) to monitor critical MySQL metrics.

    dashboardName="MySQL"
  />
</div>

## Monitoring Multiple MySQL Instances

You can monitor multiple MySQL databases by adding multiple receivers with different names:

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  mysql:
    endpoint: <endpoint-database-1>
    username: <username-database-1>
    password: <password-database-1>
    collection_interval: 10s
    initial_delay: 10s
  mysql/production:
    endpoint: <endpoint-database-2>
    username: <username-database-2>
    password: <password-database-2>
    collection_interval: 10s
    initial_delay: 10s

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [mysql, mysql/production]
      processors: [resource/env, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No metrics appearing in SigNoz**
   - Verify MySQL server is running and accessible
   - Check MySQL credentials and user permissions
   - Verify OTel Collector logs for connection errors
   - Ensure MySQL is accepting connections on the specified port

2. **Authentication errors**
   - Verify MySQL username and password are correct
   - Check if the MySQL user has appropriate privileges
   - Ensure the user can connect from the OTel Collector host

3. **Connection timeout errors**
   - Check network connectivity between OTel Collector and MySQL
   - Verify firewall rules allow connections on MySQL port (default 3306)
   - Increase timeout value in receiver configuration if needed

4. **Missing specific metrics**
   - Some metrics are only available in MySQL Enterprise edition
   - Verify MySQL version compatibility with the receiver
   - Check if specific features (like performance schema) are enabled
