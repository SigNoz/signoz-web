## Overview

Metrics Explorer provides instant visibility into all metrics flowing into your SigNoz deployment. This feature automatically discovers, categorises, and visualises every metric being ingested, giving you a complete view of your metrics ecosystem without needing to build dashboards first.

Unlike traditional monitoring workflows that require you to guess metric names from dropdowns, Metrics Explorer shows you exactly what's being ingested with real-time metadata, including types, sample counts, time series cardinality, and data sources.

## When to Use & Key Benefits

Metrics Explorer delivers specific benefits in these common scenarios:

- **During service onboarding**: Instantly verify that new integrations (AWS, Kubernetes, custom exporters) are working correctly by seeing which metrics are being ingested and from which sources.

- **When troubleshooting alerts**: Quickly investigate alert-related metrics by jumping directly from alerts to see recent activity, metadata, and correlate with related metrics—all without building temporary dashboards.

- **For cost optimization**: Identify high-volume metrics, detect unused or misconfigured metrics, and spot instrumentation redundancies to optimize your observability pipeline.

- **During incident response**: Use the query playground to run ad hoc analyses, compare multiple metrics side-by-side, and correlate performance issues across different services and hosts.

## How It Works

Metrics Explorer leverages your existing OpenTelemetry instrumentation to automatically collect and organize metrics metadata. The feature works by analyzing:

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Metric Name | The identifier for the metric | `http_requests_total` |
| Metric Type | Counter, Gauge, Histogram, or Summary | `counter` |
| Labels/Tags | Dimensional metadata attached to metrics | `service="api", method="GET"` |
| Sample Count | Number of data points received | `1,234,567` |
| Time Series | Unique metric name + label combinations | `5,432` |
| Units | Measurement units for the metric | `seconds`, `bytes`, `requests` |

These attributes automatically categorise metrics, calculate cardinality and volume, identify data sources, and provide searchable metadata for quick discovery.

## Feature Walkthrough

### Summary View

The Metrics Explorer main interface provides two primary visualisation modes:

#### Proportion View

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
    <img
      src="/img/docs/metrics/metrics-explorer/proportion-view.webp"
      alt="Proportion view showing metrics consumption and ingestion resource usage"
    />
    <figcaption>
      <i>

      </i>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

The Proportion View presents a treemap visualisation that shows the relative volume of metrics being ingested. Each rectangle represents a metric, with the size proportional to its ingestion volume. This view helps you:

- **Identify high-volume metrics** that consume the most ingestion resources
- **Spot anomalies** in metric volume distribution
- **Understand proportional impact** of different metrics on your system
- **Quickly locate** metrics that might need optimisation

#### List View

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
    <img
      src="/img/docs/metrics/metrics-explorer/list-view.webp"
      alt="Metrics Explorer list view showing detailed metrics information in tabular format"
    />
    <figcaption>
      <i>

      </i>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

The List View displays all metrics in a comprehensive table format with the following columns:

- **METRIC**: The full metric identifier with search capability
- **DESCRIPTION**: Description of what the metric measures
- **TYPE**: Metric type indicator (GAUGE, HISTOGRAM, etc.)
- **UNIT**: Measurement units for the metric
- **SAMPLES**: Total number of data points received (e.g., "178.6K+")
- **TIME SERIES**: Number of unique metric + label combinations (e.g., "1.5K+")

#### Navigation and Filtering

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
    <img
      src="/img/docs/metrics/metrics-explorer/search-and-filter-interface.webp"
      alt="Metrics Explorer search and filter interface for finding specific metrics"
    />
    <figcaption>
      <i>

      </i>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

You can navigate and filter metrics using:

- **Search Filter**: Use the search bar at the top to filter metrics by name or keywords
- **Column Sorting**: Click on any column header to sort metrics by that attribute
- **Time Range Selection**: Adjust the time window (shown as "Last 30 minutes" in the top right)
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large metric lists using the pagination controls at the bottom

### Exploring Individual Metrics

When you click on a specific metric, the interface displays information in three distinct sections:

#### 1. Basic Information Section

The top section displays essential metric details:

- **SAMPLES**: Shows the volume of data points (e.g., "40.8M+")
- **TIME SERIES**: Displays total and active time series count (e.g., "531 total — 466 active")
- **LAST RECEIVED**: Timestamp of the most recent data ingestion

#### 2. Metadata Section

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
    <img
      src="/img/docs/metrics/metrics-explorer/metadata-view-detailed.webp"
      alt="Detailed metadata view showing comprehensive metric information"
    />
    <figcaption>
      <i>
        Detailed metadata section showing comprehensive metric information
      </i>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

The Metadata section provides configurable information about the metric:

- **Metric Type**: Displayed as a colored badge (e.g., "GAUGE")
- **Description**: Human-readable description of the metric's purpose (editable)
- **Unit**: Measurement unit specification (e.g., `{pod}`)
- **Temporality**: Specification of how the metric data is aggregated

If you feel the Metric Type, description, or temporality is incorrect, you can edit them using the **edit button**.

#### 3. All Attributes Section

The "All Attributes" section displays the dimensional structure of the metric:

- **Unique Identifiers**: Shows the specific attribute values associated with the metric
- **Search Functionality**: Allows filtering through attribute values

<figure data-zoomable align="center">

      alt="Detailed All attributes section"
    />

### Explorer Interface

<figure data-zoomable align="center">

**Action Buttons**:
- **Stage & Run Query**: Execute the configured query
- **Save this view**: Preserve query configurations for reuse
- **Create an Alert**: Set up monitoring alerts based on the query
- **Add to Dashboard**: Include the visualization in existing dashboards

## Saved Views in Metrics Explorer

Similar to the [Saved Views feature](https://signoz.io/docs/product-features/saved-view/#how-to-use-saved-views) available in Logs and Traces Explorer, Metrics Explorer also supports saving your query configurations for quick access later.
