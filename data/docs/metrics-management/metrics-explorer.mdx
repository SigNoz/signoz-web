# Metrics Explorer

## Overview

Metrics Explorer provides instant visibility into all metrics flowing into your SigNoz deployment. This feature automatically discovers, categorizes, and visualizes every metric being ingested, giving you a complete view of your metrics ecosystem without needing to build dashboards first.

Unlike traditional monitoring workflows that require you to guess metric names from dropdowns, Metrics Explorer shows you exactly what's being ingested with real-time metadata including types, sample counts, time series cardinality, and data sources.

## When to Use & Key Benefits

Metrics Explorer delivers specific benefits in these common scenarios:

- **During service onboarding**: Instantly verify that new integrations (AWS, Kubernetes, custom exporters) are working correctly by seeing which metrics are being ingested and from which sources.

- **When troubleshooting alerts**: Quickly investigate alert-related metrics by jumping directly from alerts to see recent activity, metadata, and correlate with related metricsâ€”all without building temporary dashboards.

- **For cost optimization**: Identify high-volume metrics, detect unused or misconfigured metrics, and spot instrumentation redundancies to optimize your observability pipeline.

- **During incident response**: Use the query playground to run ad hoc analyses, compare multiple metrics side-by-side, and correlate performance issues across different services and hosts.

## How It Works

Metrics Explorer leverages your existing OpenTelemetry instrumentation to automatically collect and organize metrics metadata. The feature works by analyzing:

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Metric Name | The identifier for the metric | `http_requests_total` |
| Metric Type | Counter, Gauge, Histogram, or Summary | `counter` |
| Labels/Tags | Dimensional metadata attached to metrics | `service="api", method="GET"` |
| Sample Count | Number of data points received | `1,234,567` |
| Time Series | Unique metric name + label combinations | `5,432` |
| Units | Measurement units for the metric | `seconds`, `bytes`, `requests` |

These attributes are used to automatically categorize metrics, calculate cardinality and volume, identify data sources, and provide searchable metadata for quick discovery.

## Best Practices

### Efficient Exploration Strategy

**Start with Summary View**: Begin by understanding your complete metrics landscape before diving into specific metrics.

**Use Search Effectively**: Leverage the search functionality to quickly find metrics by name patterns or keywords.

**Filter by Context**: Use service, host, or integration filters to focus on relevant metrics during investigation.

**Monitor Cardinality**: Regularly review high-cardinality metrics to prevent cost surprises and performance issues.

### Troubleshooting Workflows

**Alert-Driven Investigation**: When receiving alerts, jump directly to Metrics Explorer to see current metric status and recent activity.

**Service-Focused Analysis**: Use service filters to isolate metrics related to specific components during incidents.

**Time-Based Correlation**: Compare metrics during incident timeframes to identify patterns and root causes.

**Cross-Metric Analysis**: Use the query playground to correlate multiple metrics and understand system-wide impacts.

### Cost Management

**Regular Auditing**: Perform weekly reviews of metric volume and cardinality trends to identify optimization opportunities.

**Cleanup Planning**: Use the unused metrics detection to safely remove unnecessary instrumentation.

**Growth Monitoring**: Track metric growth rates to predict future capacity needs and budget planning.

**Efficiency Tracking**: Monitor improvements after optimization efforts to validate cost reduction strategies.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Metrics not appearing in Summary View:**
- Verify metrics are being sent to the correct SigNoz endpoint
- Check that OpenTelemetry instrumentation is properly configured
- Confirm metric naming follows OpenTelemetry conventions
- Ensure time range includes recent data ingestion

**Slow query performance in playground:**
- Reduce time range for queries over large datasets
- Use specific label filters to limit data scope
- Avoid queries on extremely high-cardinality metrics
- Consider using aggregation functions to reduce data volume

**Missing or incorrect metadata:**
- Verify OpenTelemetry instrumentation includes proper metric metadata
- Check integration configuration for metadata passing
- Use the editable metadata feature to correct or add missing information
- Ensure metric units and descriptions are set at the source

**High cardinality warnings:**
- Review label dimensions that might have unlimited values
- Implement label value normalization in instrumentation
- Consider using histogram metrics instead of individual gauges for distributions
- Set up cardinality limits in metric exporters
