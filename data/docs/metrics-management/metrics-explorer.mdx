# Metrics Explorer

## Overview

Metrics Explorer provides instant visibility into all metrics flowing into your SigNoz deployment. This feature automatically discovers, categorizes, and visualizes every metric being ingested, giving you a complete view of your metrics ecosystem without needing to build dashboards first.

Unlike traditional monitoring workflows that require you to guess metric names from dropdowns, Metrics Explorer shows you exactly what's being ingested with real-time metadata including types, sample counts, time series cardinality, and data sources.

## When to Use & Key Benefits

Metrics Explorer delivers specific benefits in these common scenarios:

- **During service onboarding**: Instantly verify that new integrations (AWS, Kubernetes, custom exporters) are working correctly by seeing which metrics are being ingested and from which sources.

- **When troubleshooting alerts**: Quickly investigate alert-related metrics by jumping directly from alerts to see recent activity, metadata, and correlate with related metrics—all without building temporary dashboards.

- **For cost optimization**: Identify high-volume metrics, detect unused or misconfigured metrics, and spot instrumentation redundancies to optimize your observability pipeline.

- **During incident response**: Use the query playground to run ad hoc analyses, compare multiple metrics side-by-side, and correlate performance issues across different services and hosts.

## How It Works

Metrics Explorer leverages your existing OpenTelemetry instrumentation to automatically collect and organize metrics metadata. The feature works by analyzing:

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Metric Name | The identifier for the metric | `http_requests_total` |
| Metric Type | Counter, Gauge, Histogram, or Summary | `counter` |
| Labels/Tags | Dimensional metadata attached to metrics | `service="api", method="GET"` |
| Sample Count | Number of data points received | `1,234,567` |
| Time Series | Unique metric name + label combinations | `5,432` |
| Units | Measurement units for the metric | `seconds`, `bytes`, `requests` |

These attributes are used to automatically categorize metrics, calculate cardinality and volume, identify data sources, and provide searchable metadata for quick discovery.

## Feature Walkthrough

### Summary View

The Metrics Explorer main interface provides two primary visualization modes:

#### Proportion View

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
    <img
      src="/img/docs/metrics-explorer/proportion-view-visualization.webp"
      alt="Proportion view showing metrics consumption and ingestion resource usage"
    />
    <figcaption>
      <i>

      </i>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

The Proportion View presents a treemap visualization that shows the relative volume of metrics being ingested. Each rectangle represents a metric, with the size proportional to its ingestion volume. This view helps you:

- **Identify high-volume metrics** that consume the most ingestion resources
- **Spot anomalies** in metric volume distribution
- **Understand proportional impact** of different metrics on your system
- **Quickly locate** metrics that might need optimization

#### List View

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
    <img
      src="/img/docs/metrics-explorer/summary-view-main-table.webp"
      alt="Metrics Explorer list view showing detailed metrics information in tabular format"
    />
    <figcaption>
      <i>

      </i>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

The List View displays all metrics in a comprehensive table format with the following columns:

- **METRIC**: The full metric identifier with search capability
- **DESCRIPTION**: Description of what the metric measures
- **TYPE**: Metric type indicator (GAUGE, HISTOGRAM, etc.)
- **UNIT**: Measurement units for the metric
- **SAMPLES**: Total number of data points received (e.g., "178.6K+")
- **TIME SERIES**: Number of unique metric + label combinations (e.g., "1.5K+")

#### Navigation and Filtering

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
    <img
      src="/img/docs/metrics-explorer/search-and-filter-interface.webp"
      alt="Metrics Explorer search and filter interface for finding specific metrics"
    />
    <figcaption>
      <i>

      </i>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

You can navigate and filter metrics using:

- **Search Filter**: Use the search bar at the top to filter metrics by name or keywords
- **Column Sorting**: Click on any column header to sort metrics by that attribute
- **Time Range Selection**: Adjust the time window (shown as "Last 30 minutes" in the top right)
- **View Toggle**: Switch between Proportion View and List View using the view selector
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large metric lists using the pagination controls at the bottom

### Exploring Individual Metrics

When you click on a specific metric, the interface displays information in three distinct sections:

#### 1. Basic Information Section

The top section displays essential metric details:

- **SAMPLES**: Shows the volume of data points (e.g., "40.8M+")
- **TIME SERIES**: Displays total and active time series count (e.g., "531 total — 466 active")
- **LAST RECEIVED**: Timestamp of the most recent data ingestion

#### 2. Metadata Section

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
    <img
      src="/img/docs/metrics-explorer/metadata-view-detailed.webp"
      alt="Detailed metadata view showing comprehensive metric information"
    />
    <figcaption>
      <i>

      </i>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

The Metadata section provides configurable information about the metric:

- **Metric Type**: Displayed as a colored badge (e.g., "GAUGE")
- **Description**: Human-readable description of the metric's purpose (editable)
- **Unit**: Measurement unit specification (e.g., "{pod}")
- **Temporality**: Specification of how the metric data is aggregated

#### 3. All Attributes Section

*Note: This section is completely separate from the metadata section above*

The "All Attributes" section displays the dimensional structure of the metric:

- **Unique Identifiers**: Shows the specific attribute values associated with the metric
- **Cardinality Information**: Displays the range of values for each attribute
- **Sample Values**: Lists examples of the actual attribute values being ingested
- **Search Functionality**: Allows filtering through attribute values

This section helps you understand:
- The dimensional complexity of the metric
- Which attributes contribute to cardinality
- The actual values being sent for each dimension
- Potential optimization opportunities for high-cardinality attributes

#### Explorer Interface

<figure data-zoomable align="center">
    <img
      src="/img/docs/metrics-explorer/query-playground-interface.webp"
      alt="Explorer interface showing query building and visualization capabilities"
    />
    <figcaption>
      <i>

### How to Use Saved Views

**Saving a View:**
1. Configure your metric query with desired filters and parameters in the Explorer interface
2. Click the **"Save this view"** button 
3. Enter a descriptive label for easy identification
4. Confirm to save your view - a popup will confirm successful saving

**Accessing Saved Views:**
- Use the dropdown at the bottom of the Explorer interface
- Select any saved view to instantly apply the preset configuration
- Views are preserved across sessions for quick access

**Managing Views:**

## Best Practices

### Effective Exploration Strategies

1. **Start with Proportion View**: Use the treemap to identify metrics consuming the most resources
2. **Filter by Service**: Narrow down metrics by specific services or integrations
3. **Use Time Range Controls**: Adjust time windows to focus on relevant periods
4. **Monitor Cardinality**: Regularly check the All Attributes section to prevent cardinality issues
5. **Set Up Alerts**: Create monitoring rules for metrics that impact your key services

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**High Cardinality Metrics**:
- Review the All Attributes section to identify problematic dimensions
- Check for unbounded label values (timestamps, user IDs, etc.)
- Consider aggregating or filtering high-cardinality attributes
- Monitor time series growth trends in the basic information section

**Missing Metrics**:
- Verify instrumentation is properly configured
- Check service discovery and metric collection settings
- Review OpenTelemetry collector configuration
- Ensure proper metric naming conventions

**Performance Issues**:
- Use time range filtering to reduce query scope
- Optimize queries by limiting attribute dimensions
- Consider data retention policies for historical metrics
- Monitor ingestion rates and processing delays
