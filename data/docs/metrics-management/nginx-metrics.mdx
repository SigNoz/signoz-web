This document provides an explains how to monitor NGINX metrics using OTel Collector and SigNoz.

## Pre-requisites

- NGINX with `stub_status` module enabled

## Setup

### Step 1: Setup OTel Collector

OpenTelemetry Collector is required to collect metrics from NGINX. Please refer to the [](/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) 
to setup the agent.

### Step 2: Preparing NGINX

For the OpenTelemetry Collector to collect NGINX metrics, you need to enable the `stub_status` module and configure a status endpoint.
The `stub_status` module in NGINX provides real-time server health metrics like active connections, handled requests, and connection states. Refer to [this doc](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html) for setting up the NGINX stub_status module.


### Step 3: Collecting NGINX metrics

You will need to configure the [nginx receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/nginxreceiver) for collecting NGINX metrics. The receiver queries the NGINX status endpoint to collect performance metrics.

### Step 4: Configuring the receiver

Edit the OTel Collector config file to configure the `nginx` receiver as shown below:

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  nginx:
    endpoint: "<nginx-status-endpoint>" # Example -> http://localhost:80/nginx_status
    collection_interval: 10s
    initial_delay: 1s
    timeout: 60s
```

**Configuration parameters:**

- `endpoint`: The URL to the NGINX status page (required)
- `collection_interval`: How often to collect metrics (default: 1m)
- `initial_delay`: Delay before starting collection (default: 1s)  
- `timeout`: Request timeout (default: 10s)

You can find more details about the NGINX receiver configuration in the [receiver documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/nginxreceiver).


### Step 5: Configuring the pipelines

Once the receiver and processor is configured, make sure to also enable them in the `pipelines` section of the OTel Collector config file:

```yaml:config.yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [nginx]
      processors: [resourcedetection, attributes]
```

## Visualizing NGINX Metrics

Once you have configured OTel Collector to send NGINX metrics to SigNoz, you can start visualizing the metrics in the [metrics explorer](https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/metrics-explorer/).

You can use the pre-configured [dashboard for NGINX](https://signoz.io/docs/dashboards/dashboard-templates/nginx/) metrics which provides

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No metrics appearing in SigNoz**
   - Verify NGINX status endpoint is accessible
   - Check OTel Collector logs for connection errors
   - Ensure firewall allows access to the status endpoint

2. **Permission denied errors**
   - Check NGINX access restrictions on the status endpoint
   - Verify the IP address of OTel Collector is allowed

3. **Metrics showing zero values**
   - Confirm NGINX is receiving traffic
   - Verify the status endpoint shows non-zero values
   - Check if NGINX was recently restarted (counters reset)
