title: Alerts Firing Without Visible Threshold Breach
---

## Problem Description
Your alert fires but when checking dashboards or explorer views, the metric appears below the configured threshold. This guide helps diagnose why alerts trigger when they shouldn't appear to.

## Common Root Causes

### 1. Evaluation Window Mismatch

**Issue:** Alert evaluates over different time window than your dashboard displays.

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Alert configuration
evaluation_window: 5m    # Alert checks last 5 minutes
dashboard_view: 15m      # You're viewing last 15 minutes

# Fix: Match your dashboard time range to alert evaluation window
```

**Verification Steps:**
1. Navigate to Alerts â†’ Edit Alert
2. Note the evaluation window (e.g., "for 5 minutes")
3. Set dashboard to exact same time range
4. Check if threshold breach becomes visible

### 2. Aggregation Method Conflicts

**Issue:** Using incompatible aggregation for your metric type.

**Common Mistakes:**
- `count_distinct` on continuous values
- `p99` on sparse data (insufficient samples)

### 3. "At Least Once" vs "In Total" Evaluation

**Issue:** Alert condition evaluates differently than expected.

**Behavior Differences:**
- **At least once:** Fires if ANY datapoint exceeds threshold
- **In total:** Fires if aggregated value over entire window exceeds threshold

**Example:**
```yaml
# CPU usage datapoints over 5-minute window: [70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 70%]
threshold: 90%

at_least_once: DOES NOT FIRE (no single datapoint > 90%)
in_total: FIRES (sum: 70+75+80+85+70 = 380% > 90% threshold)
```

### 4. Time Synchronization Issues

**Issue:** Metrics arrive with incorrect timestamps.

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check clock drift on all monitored hosts
for host in $(cat hosts.txt); do
  echo "Host: $host"
  ssh $host 'timedatectl show | grep NTPSynchronized'
done
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# Enable NTP synchronization
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
sudo systemctl restart chronyd  # or ntpd
```

### 5. Missing Data Points & Sparse Metrics

**Issue:** Gaps in data cause unexpected evaluations.

**SigNoz Behavior:**
- Missing data points are NOT interpolated by default
- Sparse metrics may not have enough samples for percentile calculations

**Solutions:**
1. **For sparse metrics:** Use longer evaluation windows
2. **For missing data:** Configure "No Data" alerts separately
3. **For percentiles:** Ensure minimum 20 samples in evaluation window

### 6. Collection Interval Alignment

**Issue:** Evaluation window not aligned with scrape interval.

**Problem:**
```yaml
# Problematic configuration
scrape_interval: 45s
evaluation_window: 1m  # Only captures 1-2 samples

# Recommended
scrape_interval: 15s
evaluation_window: 5m  # Captures ~20 samples
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Increase evaluation window:** Use windows that capture at least 10-20 data points
2. **Decrease collection interval:** More frequent collection provides better data density
3. **Rule of thumb:** Evaluation window should be 5-10x the collection interval
