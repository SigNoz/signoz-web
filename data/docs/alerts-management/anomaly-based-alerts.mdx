An Anomaly-based alert in SigNoz allows you to define conditions based on metric data and trigger alerts when the metric data deviates from the expected behavior. Here's a breakdown of the various sections and options available when configuring an Anomaly-based alert:

## Step 1: Define the Metric
In this step, you use the [Metrics Query Builder](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/#metrics-query-builder)
to choose the metric to monitor. The following fields that are available in Metrics Query Builder includes:

- **Metric**: A field to select the specific metric you want to monitor (e.g., CPU usage, memory utilization).

- **Time aggregation**: A field to select the time aggregation function to use for the metric. Learn more about [time aggregation](../../metrics-management/types-and-aggregation/#aggregation)

- **WHERE**: A filter field to define specific conditions for the metric. You can apply logical operators like "IN," "NOT IN".

- **Space aggregation**: A field to select the space aggregation function to use for the metric. Learn more about [space aggregation](../../metrics-management/types-and-aggregation/#aggregation)

- **[Legend Format](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/#legend-format)**: An optional field to customize the legend's format in the visual representation of the alert.

- **Having**: Apply conditions to filter the results further based on aggregate value.

To know more about the functionalities of the Query Builder, checkout the [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/).

## Step 2: Define Alert Conditions
In this step, you define the specific conditions that trigger the alert and the notification frequency. The following fields are available:

- **Evaluation window**: Specify the rolling time window for the condition evaluation. The following look back options are available:
  - Last 5 minutes
  - Last 10 minutes
  - Last 15 minutes
  - Last 1 hour
  - Last 4 hours
  - Last 1 day

- **Z-score threshold**: Specify the Z-score threshold for the alert condition.

- **Condition**: Specify when the metric should trigger the notification
  - Above threshold
  - Below threshold
  - Above or below threshold

- **Occurrence**: Specify how condition should be evaluated
  - At least once
  - Every time

- **Algorithm**: Specify the algorithm to use for the anomaly detection. The following algorithms are available:
  - Standard

- **Seasonality**: Specify the seasonality for the anomaly detection. The following seasonality options are available:
  - Hourly
  - Daily
  - Weekly

- **More Options** :

    - **Run alert every [X mins]**: This option determines the frequency at which the alert is evaluated.

    - **Send a notification if data is missing for [X] mins**: A field to specify if a notification should be sent when data is missing for a certain period.

## Step 3: Alert Configuration
In this step, you set the alert's metadata, including severity, name, and description:

### Severity
Set the severity level for the alert (e.g., "Warning" or "Critical").

### Alert Name
A field to name the alert for easy identification.

### Alert Description

Add a detailed description for the alert, explaining its purpose and trigger conditions.

You can incorporate result attributes in the alert descriptions to make the alerts more informative:

**Syntax**: Use `$<attribute-name>` to insert attribute values. Attribute values can be any attribute used in group by.

**Example**: If you have a query that has the attribute `service.name` in the group by clause then to use it in the alert description, you will use `$service.name`.

#### Slack alert format

Using [advanced slack formatting](https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting#advanced) is supported if you are using Slack as a notification channel.

### Labels
A field to add static labels or tags for categorization. Labels should be added in key value pairs. First enter key (avoid space in key) and set value.

### Notification channels
A field to choose the [notification channels](https://signoz.io/docs/setup-alerts-notification) from those configured in the Alert Channel settings.

### Test Notification
A button to test the alert to ensure that it works as expected.

## How It Works

### Prediction Model

The system predicts expected values using the formula:

```
Predicted Value = Average(Past Period) + Average(Current Season) - Mean(Past 3 Seasons)
```

Where:

- **Past Period**: The immediate previous period (hour/day/week)
- **Current Season**: The current seasonal window up to now
- **Past Seasons**: Three consecutive previous seasonal periods

### Seasonality Options

The system supports three types of seasonality:
- **Hourly**: For metrics that follow hourly patterns
- **Daily**: For metrics that follow daily patterns
- **Weekly**: For metrics that follow weekly patterns

### Time Windows

Based on the selected seasonality, the system analyzes:
1. **Current Period**: The window you're analyzing (e.g., last 5 minutes)
2. **Past Period**: Previous period with 5-minute offset
   - Hourly: last hour
   - Daily: last day
   - Weekly: last week
3. **Seasonal Windows**: Multiple seasonal periods for trend analysis
   - Current Season
   - Past Season
   - Past 2 Seasons
   - Past 3 Seasons

### Anomaly Score Calculation
1. **Standard Deviation**: Calculated from the current season's data
2. **Anomaly Score**: `|Actual Value - Predicted Value| / Standard Deviation`
3. **Bounds**:
   - Upper Bound = Moving Average(Predicted) + (z-score × Standard Deviation)
   - Lower Bound = Moving Average(Predicted) - (z-score × Standard Deviation)

### Best Practices

1. **Choosing Seasonality**
   - Select based on your metric's natural cycle
   - Consider business patterns and user behavior
   - Start with the most obvious pattern (e.g., daily for most business metrics)

2. **Setting Z-Score Threshold**
   - Default: 3 (catches significant anomalies)
   - Lower for more sensitive detection
   - Higher for fewer false positives

3. **Time Window Selection**
   - Use appropriate intervals based on metric volatility

### Limitations and Considerations

1. **Data Requirements**
   - Needs at least 4 seasonal periods of historical data
   - More historical data improves prediction accuracy
   - Missing data points may affect accuracy

2. **Sensitivity**
   - May be sensitive to sudden seasonal pattern changes
   - Requires tuning for metrics with high variability
   - Consider business context when setting thresholds

## Examples

### 1. Web Traffic Monitoring
- **Seasonality**: Daily
- **Use Case**: Detect unusual spikes or drops in website traffic
- **Benefits**: Accounts for daily patterns (work hours vs. off hours) while adapting to growth trends

### 2. Weekly Business Metrics
- **Seasonality**: Weekly
- **Use Case**: Monitor business KPIs (sales, signups)
- **Benefits**: Accounts for weekly business cycles and seasonal trends
