A Log-based alert allows you to define conditions based on log data, triggering alerts when these conditions are met. Here's a breakdown of the various sections and options available when configuring a Log-based alert:

## Step 1: Define the Log Metric

In this step, you use the [Logs Query Builder](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/#logs-and-traces-query-builder)
to apply filters and operations on your logs to define conditions which triggers log based alert Some of the fields that are available in Logs Query Builder includes:

- **Logs**: A field to filter the specific log data to monitor. 

- **Aggregate Attribute**: Allows you to select how the log data should be aggregated (e.g., "Count").

- **Group by**: Provides options to group log data by various attributes, such as "service.name", "method" or custom attributes.

- **[Legend Format](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/#legend-format)**: Lets you define the format for the legend in the visual representation of the alert.

- **Having**: Apply conditions to filter the results further based on aggregate value.

## Step 2: Define Alert Conditions
In this step, you define the specific conditions for triggering the alert, as well as the frequency of checking those conditions:

- **Send a notification when [A] is [above/below] the threshold [in total] during the last [X mins]**: A template to set the threshold and define when the alert condition should be checked.

- **Alert Threshold**: A field to specify the threshold value for the alert condition.

- **More Options** :

    - **Run alert every [X mins]**: This option determines the frequency at which the alert condition is checked and notifications are sent.

    - **Send a notification if data is missing for [X] mins**: A field to specify if a notification should be sent when data is missing for a certain period.

## Step 3: Alert Configuration
In this step, you set the alert's metadata, including severity, name, and description:

### Severity
Set the severity level for the alert (e.g., "Warning" or "Critical").

### Alert Name
A field to name the alert for easy identification.

### Alert Description

Add a detailed description for the alert, explaining its purpose and trigger conditions.

You can incorporate result labels in the alert descriptions to make the alerts more informative:

**Syntax**: Use `{{.Labels.<label-name>}}` to insert label values. Label values can be any attribute used in group by. Ensure that all `.` (dots) in attribute are converted to `_`

**Example**: If you have a query that has the label `service.name` then to use it in the alert description, you will use `{{.Labels.service_name}}`which creates an alert that is specific to the particular service.

### Labels
A field to add labels or tags for categorization. Labels should be added in key value pairs. First enter key (avoid space in key) and set value.

### Notification channels
A field to choose the [notification channels](https://signoz.io/docs/setup-alerts-notification) from those configured in the Alert Channel settings.

### Test Notification
A button to test the alert to ensure that it works as expected.

## Examples

### 1. Alert when percentage of `redis timeout` error logs greater than 7% in last 5 mins


#### Here's a video tutorial for creating this alert:

#### Step 1: Write Query Builder query to define alert metric

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/alerts/logs/too-many-redis-timeouts-metric.png" alt="logs builder query for redis timeout logs percentage"/>
    <figcaption><i>Redis timeout query</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Here we write 2 queries to calculate error logs percent. First query to count logs which are `redis timeout` error logs.
Second query to count total logs. Then we add a formula to calculate percentage.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/alerts/logs/too-many-redis-timeouts-chart.png" alt="error logs percentage chart"/>
    <figcaption><i>Error log percentage chart</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<Admonition type="info">
Remember to select y-axis unit as Percent(0-100) as we want to apply threshold in percent.
</Admonition>
<br></br>
#### Step 2: Set alert conditions

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/alerts/logs/too-many-redis-timeouts-conditions.png" alt="redis timeout alert condition"/>
    <figcaption><i>Error logs percentage alert condition</i></figcaption>
</figure>

The condition is set to trigger a notification if the per-minute error logs percentage exceeds the threshold of 1 second on average in the last five minutes.

#### Step 3: Set alert configuration

At last configure the alert as `Warning`, add a name and notification channel.
