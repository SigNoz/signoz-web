# Creating SigNoz Alert using Terraform 

The configuration of alerts for a monitoring target is the very definition of what the team perceives as a “problem” and should be managed as properly as the application code.
By defining SigNoz alerts as Terraform code, it is possible to manage changes to the alert settings.

## Overview

SigNoz alert notifies you of the change in the state of your service.
Although setting smart, effective alerts can be achieved using [SigNoz UI](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/alerts-management/), **Terraform 'signoz' provider** will help you manage SigNoz alerts as reviewable codes.

This document will show you how to:
- configure the provider
- create a new alert on SigNoz Cloud
- start managing preexistent alerts using Terraform

## Prerequisites

- Terraform
  - version of Terraform runtime: [v0.13.0](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v0.13.0) or later
  - version of signoz provider: [0.0.4](https://github.com/SigNoz/terraform-provider-signoz/releases/tag/v0.0.4) or later
- SigNoz Cloud
  - endpoint URL
  - api key

## Configure Terraform Provider

### Step 1: Configure Terraform environment

Create `.tf` file with an arbitrary name (`main.tf` is commonly used) and add the following content:
```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.13"
}
```

### Step 2: Install Terraform signoz Provider

Add specification block for the signoz provider as follows:
```diff
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.13"

+ required_providers {
+   signoz = {
+     source = "Signoz/signoz"
+     version = "~>0.0.4"
+   }
+ }
}
```

Run:
```terraform
terraform init 
```

This will create `.terraform.lock.hcl` file, which locks the provider version for consistent usage.

### Step 3: Configure signoz Provider

Add `provider {}` block to the `.tf` file as follows:
```hcl
provider "signoz" {}
```

By setting the environmental variables below, the signoz provider will automatically read these variables and authorize with your SigNoz Cloud account:
``` bash
SIGNOZ_ACCESS_TOEKN="your-api-key"
SIGNOZ_ENDPOINT="https://your-signoz-endpoint"
```

You can explicitly set these variables in the `provider {}` block as shown below, but avoid hardcoding your API key if you plan to commit your `.tf` files to an online version control system.
```hcl
provider "signoz" {
  endpoint="https://your-signoz-endpoint"
  access_token = <api_key>  # Do not type your token directly if you push codes online
}
```
## Create new alert
### Step 1: Define SigNoz Alert as Code

Define your alert using the `signoz_alert` resource type as follows:
```hcl
resource "signoz_alert" "example" {
  alert      = "Example alert"
  alert_type = "METRIC_BASED_ALERT"
  condition = jsonencode(
    {
      "absentFor" : 10,
      "alertOnAbsent" : true,
      "compositeQuery" : {
        "builderQueries" : {
          "A" : {
            "IsAnomaly" : false,
            "QueriesUsedInFormula" : null,
            "ShiftBy" : 0,
            "aggregateAttribute" : {
              "dataType" : "float64",
              "isColumn" : true,
              "isJSON" : false,
              "key" : "k8s_node_memory_rss",
              "type" : "Gauge"
            },
            "aggregateOperator" : "avg",
            "dataSource" : "metrics",
            "disabled" : false,
            "expression" : "A",
            "filters" : {
              "items" : [],
              "op" : "AND"
            },
            "groupBy" : [
              {
                "dataType" : "string",
                "isColumn" : false,
                "isJSON" : false,
                "key" : "k8s_node_name",
                "type" : "tag"
              }
            ],
            "limit" : 0,
            "offset" : 0,
            "pageSize" : 0,
            "queryName" : "A",
            "reduceTo" : "avg",
            "spaceAggregation" : "avg",
            "stepInterval" : 60,
            "timeAggregation" : "avg"
          }
        },
        "chQueries" : {
          "A" : {
            "disabled" : false,
            "query" : ""
          }
        },
        "panelType" : "graph",
        "promQueries" : {
          "A" : {
            "disabled" : false,
            "query" : ""
          }
        },
        "queryType" : "builder",
        "unit" : "bytes"
      },
      "matchType" : "1",
      "op" : "1",
      "selectedQueryName" : "A",
      "target" : 10,
      "targetUnit" : "gbytes"
    }
  )
  severity           = "info"
  broadcast_to_all   = false
  preferred_channels = []
  rule_type          = "threshold_rule"
  description        = "An example alert created by Terraform"
  eval_window        = "5m0s"
  frequency          = "1m0s"
  labels = {
    "environment" = "test"
  }
}
   ```
This configuration defines:
- condition: Trigger alerts if `k8s_node_memory_rss` is missing for 10 seconds.
- metric: Aggregates the average value of the `k8s_node_memory_rss` metric grouped by Kubernetes node name.
- interval: Evaluates the metric every 1 minutes with 5-minutes evaluation window.

### Step 2: Check Correctness of Definition

After defining your alert, validate its syntax by running `validate` command:
```bash
terraform validate
```
If the resource is defined correctly, you will see the message: `Success! The configuration is valid.`

In case you get any error, fix your definition by referencing the console output:

<Figure src="/img/docs/alerts/terraform-provider-validate-error.webp" alt="Error message returned from `terraform validate`" caption="Error message returned from `terraform validate`" />

The error indicates that:
- the required argument alert_type` was not found.
- an unexpected argument `alert_typ was passed.

Fix the typo that caused this error:
```diff
 resource "signoz_alert" "example" {
   alert      = "Example alert"
-  alert_typ = "METRIC_BASED_ALERT"
+  alert_type = "METRIC_BASED_ALERT"
   condition = jsonencode(
     {
       "absentFor" : 10,
```

### Step 3: Provision SigNoz Alert to SigNoz Cloud

When you're ready, `plan` your Terraform module to see diffs between your code and resources on the remote (SigNoz Cloud):

```terraform
terraform plan
```

<Figure src="/img/docs/alerts/terraform-provider-plan.webp" alt="Successful output from `terraform plan`" caption="Successful output from `terraform plan`" />

The output indicates that it plans to create a new resource(`signoz_alert`)  with specified attributes like `alert`, `alert_type`, and `version`. The plan shows **1 resource to add**, with no changes or deletions.

Once you're satisfied that the diffs are as intended, `apply` your code for provisioning:

```terraform
terraform apply
```
<Figure src="/img/docs/alerts/terraform-provider-apply.webp" alt="Confirmation prompt during `terraform apply`" caption="Confirmation prompt during `terraform apply`" />

Terraform will wait for your confirmation before applying the change to the remote.

Review the diffs on the console again and type `yes` to confirm:
<Figure src="/img/docs/alerts/terraform-provider-apply-complete.webp" alt="Successful output from `terraform apply`" caption="Successful output from `terraform apply`" />

After getting the success message on the console, you'll find the alert provisioned on the remote:
<Figure src="/img/docs/alerts/terraform-provider-created-resource.webp" alt="The alert created by Terraform" caption="The alert created by Terraform" />

## Manage Preexistent Alert as Terraform Resource

In **Terraform v1.5.0 and later**, you can use an `import {}` block to import a preexistent SigNoz alert.

Define the target alert as a Terraform resource as explained in the previous section, and relate it to the resource on remote.

Specify the id of the target alert to the `id` field:
```hcl
import {
  to = signoz_alert.example
  id = "123"
}
```

You can do the same by the command:
``` bash
terraform import signoz_alert.example 123
```

## Conclusion

Using Terraform, you can manage both new and pre-existent SigNoz alert as code.
The IaC practice enables you to introduce change process management of SigNoz alert and will contribute to the improvement of the operation process of your service.
