## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with the Email integration:

- **Verify Email Addresses**: Confirm that the email addresses entered in SigNoz are valid and active.
- **Test Connectivity**: Use the Test button in SigNoz to check connectivity with your email provider. If the test fails, review your network settings and SMTP Server info.
