### Docker

Based on your Docker installation, you can include the following section in your Docker Compose YAML file to configure alertmanager.

- Docker Standalone: `deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml`
- Docker Swarm: `deploy/docker-swarm/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml`

```yaml {4-8}
services:
  alertmanager:
    environment:
      - ALERTMANAGER_SMTP_FROM=<email address>
      - ALERTMANAGER_SMTP_HOST=<smtp host>
      - ALERTMANAGER_SMTP_PORT=<smtp port>
      - ALERTMANAGER_SMTP_AUTH_USERNAME=<smtp user>
      - ALERTMANAGER_SMTP_AUTH_PASSWORD=<smtp password>
```

### Kubernetes

You can include the following section in your Helm override values YAML file.

```yaml
alertmanager:
  additionalEnvs:
    ALERTMANAGER_SMTP_FROM: <email address>
    ALERTMANAGER_SMTP_HOST: <smtp host>
    ALERTMANAGER_SMTP_PORT: <smtp port>
    ALERTMANAGER_SMTP_AUTH_USERNAME: <smtp user>
    ALERTMANAGER_SMTP_AUTH_PASSWORD: <smtp password>
```

**Test Configuration**: 
Click the Test button to send a test alert to the configured email addresses. This verifies that SigNoz can communicate with your email provider.

## Editing a Notification channel

To edit an existing email notification channel:
- Navigate to the channel settings in SigNoz.
- You can edit the email addresses and other parameters. However, note that the channel name and type are not editable after creation.

## Receiving Alerts in Email

Once configured correctly, alerts from SigNoz will be sent to Email whenever monitored metrics cross the thresholds specified in your alert rules.This ensures you are promptly notified of any issues in your applications or infrastructure components.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with the Email integration:

- **Check the SMTP Server info**: Ensure that the SMTP Host, Port, User and Password entered in SigNoz matches the one provided by your email provider.
- **Verify Email Addresses**: Confirm that the email addresses entered in SigNoz are valid and active.
- **Test Connectivity**: Use the Test button in SigNoz to check connectivity with your email provider. If the test fails, review your network settings and SMTP Server info.
