Before configuring a Webhook channel in SigNoz, ensure that you have:

- **Webhook Application**: Have an application ready to accept webhook messages.

- **Webhook URL**: Obtain a valid webhook URL reachable from SigNoz Alert Manager.

- **SigNoz Version**: Ensure you are using SigNoz version Webhook [v0.7.4](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.7.4) or later

## Accessing Alert Channels

To manage your alert channels in SigNoz:

- Navigate to `Settings > Alert Channels` tab within SigNoz. This tab displays a list of configured alert channels.

## Receive Alert through Webhook

Once the configuration is set up correctly, you will receive alerts in your application through the configured Webhook channel whenever monitored metrics exceed the specified thresholds in alert rules.

## Sample Webhook message
A webhook message may contain multiple alerts. By default, the SigNoz alert manager groups alerts by the alert name and delivers grouped messages every 5 minutes.

For resolved alerts, the alert manager will send the time of resolution in _endsAt_. You can also use the fingerprint property to identify and process updates sent by the alert manager. 

```json
{
   "receiver":"w1",
   "status":"firing",
   "alerts":[
      {
         "status":"firing",
         "labels":{
            "alertname":"DiskRunningFull",
            "dev":"sda3",
            "instance":"example3",
            "severity":"critical"
         },
         "annotations":{
            "info":"The disk sda3 is running full",
            "summary":"please check the instance example1"
         },
         "startsAt":"2022-04-25T14:35:19.490146+05:30",
         "endsAt":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
         "generatorURL":"",
         "fingerprint":"ad592b0afcbe2e79"
      }
   ],
   "groupLabels":{
      "alertname":"DiskRunningFull"
   },
   "commonLabels":{
      "alertname":"DiskRunningFull",
      "dev":"sda3",
      "instance":"example3",
      "severity":"critical"
   },
   "commonAnnotations":{
      "info":"The disk sda3 is running full",
      "summary":"please check the instance example1"
   },
   "externalURL":"http://Apples-MacBook-Pro-3.local:9093",
   "version":"4",
   "groupKey":"{}/{}:{alertname=\"DiskRunningFull\"}",
   "truncatedAlerts":0
}
```

## Turn-off Resolved alerts

The resolve alerts toggle is switched on by default. To turn-off receiveing the Resolved alerts for your Notification Channel, follow these steps:
- Navigate to `Settings > Alert Channels` 
- Click on `Edit` button for a particular alert.
- Toggle off the **Send resolved alerts** button and hit `Save`.

## Integrating with Incident.io, Rootly and Zenduty and more

You can integrate with Incident.io, Rootly and Zenduty and more by following the links below:

- [Integrate with Incident.io](/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel/incident-io)
- [Integrate with Rootly](/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel/rootly)
- [Integrate with Zenduty](/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel/zenduty)

## My incident management tool is not listed, can I still integrate?

Yes, you can integrate with any tool that supports Prometheus Alertmanager webhook integration.

1. On the tool you want to integrate with, check if they have a Prometheus Alertmanager integration.
2. If they do, follow the steps to create webhook URL and secret.
3. Copy the webhook URL and use it in the SigNoz Alertmanager webhook integration.
4. (if applicable) Copy the secret and use it in the SigNoz Channel password field (leave the username empty).
5. On SigNoz, Click on the "Test" button to test the integration.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

- **Check the Webhook URL**: Ensure the webhook URL is correctly entered in SigNoz.

- **Verify Webhook Permissions**: Confirm that the webhook has permissions to post alerts to the desired endpoint.
