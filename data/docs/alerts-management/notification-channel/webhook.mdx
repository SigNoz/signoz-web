## Prerequisites

Before configuring a Webhook channel in SigNoz, ensure that you have:

- **Webhook Application**: Have an application ready to accept webhook messages.

- **Webhook URL**: Obtain a valid webhook URL reachable from SigNoz Alert Manager.

- **SigNoz Version**: Ensure you are using SigNoz version Webhook [v0.7.4](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.7.4) or later

## Accessing Alert Channels

To manage your alert channels in SigNoz:

- Navigate to `Settings > Alert Channels` tab within SigNoz. This tab displays a list of configured alert channels.

- Navigate to `Settings > Alert Channels` and click on `New Channel`.
- Enter a **Name** for the channel and select Webhook as the channel type.
- **Webhook URL**: Enter the Webhook URL endpoint.

## Editing a Webhook channel
To edit an existing webhook notification channel:
- Navigate to the channel settings in SigNoz.
- You can edit the webhook URL and other parameters. However, note that the channel name and type are not editable after creation.

## Receive Alert through Webhook

Once the configuration is set up correctly, you will receive alerts in your application through the configured Webhook channel whenever monitored metrics exceed the specified thresholds in alert rules.

## Sample Webhook message
A webhook message may contain multiple alerts. By default, the SigNoz alert manager groups alerts by the alert name and delivers grouped messages every 5 minutes.

For resolved alerts, the alert manager will send the time of resolution in _endsAt_. You can also use the fingerprint property to identify and process updates sent by the alert manager. 

```json
{
   "receiver":"w1",
   "status":"firing",
   "alerts":[
      {
         "status":"firing",
         "labels":{
            "alertname":"DiskRunningFull",
            "dev":"sda3",
            "instance":"example3",
            "severity":"critical"
         },
         "annotations":{
            "info":"The disk sda3 is running full",
            "summary":"please check the instance example1"
         },
         "startsAt":"2022-04-25T14:35:19.490146+05:30",
         "endsAt":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
         "generatorURL":"",
         "fingerprint":"ad592b0afcbe2e79"
      }
   ],
   "groupLabels":{
      "alertname":"DiskRunningFull"
   },
   "commonLabels":{
      "alertname":"DiskRunningFull",
      "dev":"sda3",
      "instance":"example3",
      "severity":"critical"
   },
   "commonAnnotations":{
      "info":"The disk sda3 is running full",
      "summary":"please check the instance example1"
   },
   "externalURL":"http://Apples-MacBook-Pro-3.local:9093",
   "version":"4",
   "groupKey":"{}/{}:{alertname=\"DiskRunningFull\"}",
   "truncatedAlerts":0
}
```

## Turn-off Resolved alerts

The resolve alerts toggle is switched on by default. To turn-off receiveing the Resolved alerts for your Notification Channel, follow these steps:
- Navigate to `Settings > Alert Channels` 
- Click on `Edit` button for a particular alert.
- Toggle off the **Send resolved alerts** button and hit `Save`.

## Integration with Incident.io

SigNoz can be integrated with Incident.io to create incidents from alerts. It uses the Prometheus Alertmanager webhook integration to send alerts to Incident.io.

### Steps to integrate

1. On Incident.io, navigate to `Settings > Integrations`
2. Search for "Prometheus" in the search bar
<Figure src="/img/docs/alerts/prometheus_incident_io.png" alt="Incident.io Integrations" caption="Incident.io Integrations" />
3. Click on the "Prometheus Alertmanager" integration
4. Click on the Connect button
<Figure src="/img/docs/alerts/prometheus_incident_io_connect.png" alt="Incident.io Connect" caption="Incident.io Connect" />
5. Give the source name as "SigNoz" or something similar that helps you identify the source as SigNoz
<Figure src="/img/docs/alerts/prometheus_incident_io_give_name.png" alt="Incident.io Give Name" caption="Incident.io Give Name" />
6. Click on the "Continue" button
7. Copy the webhook URL and use it in the SigNoz Channel webhook integration
8. Copy the "credentials" and paste it in the SigNoz Channel password field (leave the username empty)

9. On SigNoz, Click on the "Test" button to test the integration

## Integration with Rootly

1. On Rootly, navigate to `Configuration > Integrations`
2. Search for "Prometheus" in the search bar

3. Click on the "Prometheus Alertmanager" integration
4. Click on the "Setup" button
5. Copy the webhook URL and use it in the SigNoz Alertmanager webhook integration
6. Copy the "secret" and paste it in the SigNoz Channel password field (leave the username empty)

7. On SigNoz, Click on the "Test" button to test the integration

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

- **Check the Webhook URL**: Ensure the webhook URL is correctly entered in SigNoz.

- **Verify Webhook Permissions**: Confirm that the webhook has permissions to post alerts to the desired endpoint.
