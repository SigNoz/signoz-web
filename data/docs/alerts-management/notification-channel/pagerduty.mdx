title: Configure PagerDuty Channel
---

## Prerequisites
Before setting up PagerDuty as a notification channel in SigNoz, ensure the following:

- **Valid Integration Key**: You have a valid Integration Key (also known as Routing Key) from PagerDuty.
- **SigNoz Version**: [v0.8.0](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.8.0) or later


There are two main ways to integrate with PagerDuty:

- **Global [Event Orchestration](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/event-orchestration)**: Ideal for automating incident creation and management.
- **Direct Integration on [PagerDuty service](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations)**: Suitable for specific service-level integrations.

## Accessing Alert Channels

To manage your alert channels in SigNoz:

- Navigate to `Settings > Alert Channels` tab within SigNoz. This tab displays a list of configured alert channels.

When multiple channels are set up, alerts will be sent to all the configured channels.

2. Create a new orchestration 
3. Click on **Global Orchestration Key** and copy your **integration key** and keep it safe for later use.

1. Navigate to **Services > Service Directory** and select the **service** where youâ€™d like to add the integration.
2. Select **Integration tab** and click **Add another integration**
3. Select **Events API V2** from the list 
4. Click **Add**
5. Locate your integration in the list and click down arrow to view and copy integration key.

## Create a New PagerDuty Channel
To create a new PagerDuty notification channel in SigNoz, follow these steps:

- Navigate to `Settings > Alert Channels` and click on `New Channel`.
- Enter a **Name** for the channel and select PagerDuty as the channel type.
- **Routing Key**: Enter Routing Key (Integration Key) obtained from PagerDuty.
- **More information**: Enter more information as necessary. Refer to the [Events API V2 Overview](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjExMDI5NTgw-events-api-v2-overview) for more details.

You can use [Go templates](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/notifications/) for customizing the title and description.

**Test Configuration**: 
Click the Test button to test the connection with your application.

## Testing the PagerDuty channel
1. Let's create a simple alert rule that monitors average CPU performance for each host. Go to **Alerts** page in **your SigNoz app** and click `New Alert` button. When the new alert page opens, edit metric query as shown below. Feel free to choose any other metric, the idea is to pick a metric with sufficient data to raise an alert.

2. We can now **review the graph** to identify a threshold that will definitely cause an alert. Here, anything below 0.2 looks like a good condition for threshold.

3. Let's **set threshold to 0.12** to be sure that alert will be raised in next few minutes.

4. **Save the alert** rule. Feel free to edit severity and labels as necessary.

5. Go to your **PagerDuty Alerts Dashboard** (`PagerDuty Home >> Incident >> Alerts`) and wait for a few minutes. If all goes well, you will **see an incident**. You may have to refresh the page few times to see the alert.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with the PagerDuty integration:

- **Check the Integration Key**: Ensure that the Routing Key or Integration Key is correctly entered in SigNoz.
- **Verify PagerDuty Configuration**: Confirm that the PagerDuty service or global event orchestration is set up correctly.
- **Test Connectivity**: Use the Test button in SigNoz to verify connectivity with PagerDuty. If the test fails, review your network settings and integration key.
