A Trace-based alert in SigNoz allows you to define conditions based on trace data, triggering alerts when these conditions are met. Here's a breakdown of the various sections and options available when configuring a Trace-based alert:

## Step 1: Define the Trace Metric

In this step, you use the [Traces Query Builder](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/#logs-and-traces-query-builder)
to perform operations on your Traces to define conditions based on traces data. Some of the fields that are available in Traces Query Builder includes

- **Traces**: A field to filter the trace data to monitor. 

- **Aggregate Attribute**: Allows you to choose how the trace data should be aggregated. You can use functions like "Count."

- **Group by**: Lets you group trace data by different attributes, like "serviceName," "Status," or other custom attributes.

- **[Legend Format](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/#legend-format)**: An optional field to define the format for the legend in the visual representation of the alert.

- **Having**: Apply conditions to filter the results further based on aggregate value.

## Step 2: Define Alert Conditions
In this step, you set specific conditions for triggering the alert and determine the frequency of checking these conditions:

- **Send a notification when [A] is [above/below] the threshold in total during the last [X] mins**: A template to set the threshold for the alert, allowing you to define when the alert condition should be checked.

- **Alert Threshold**: A field to specify the threshold value for the alert condition.

- **More Options** :

    - **Run alert every [X mins]**: This option determines the frequency at which the alert condition is checked and notifications are sent.

    - **Send a notification if data is missing for [X] mins**: A field to specify if a notification should be sent when data is missing for a certain period.

## Step 3: Alert Configuration
This step is for setting the alert's severity, name, and other descriptive details:

- **Severity**: Set the severity level for the alert, like "Warning" or "Critical."

- **Alert Name**: A field to name the alert for easy identification.

- **Alert Description**: Add a detailed description for the alert, explaining its purpose and trigger conditions.

- **Labels**: A field to add tags or labels for easier categorization.

- **Notification channels**: A field to choose the notification channels from those configured in the Alert Channel settings.

- **Test Notification**: A button to test the alert to ensure that it works as expected.

### Result labels in alert description

You can incorporate result labels in the alert descriptions to make the alerts more informative:

**Syntax**: Use `{{.Labels.<label-name>}}` to insert label values. 

**Example**: If you have a query that returns the label `service_name` then to use it in the alert description, you will use `{{.Labels.service_name}}`which creates an alert that is specific to the particular service.

## Example
An example Trace-based alert could be set to trigger when a specific operation exceeds a latency threshold:
- **Y-axis unit**: "nanoseconds(ns)"
- **Aggregate attribute**: "durationNano"
- **Group by**: "serviceName"
- **Alert Threshold**: "200 milliseconds(ms)"
- **Run alert every**: 1 minute
- **Send a notification if data is missing for** 5 minutes
- **Alert Name**: "High Latency Alert"
- **Severity**: "Warning"
- **Notification Channels**: signoz-slack-alerts (Slack channel)
