---


A Trace-based alert in SigNoz allows you to define conditions based on trace data, triggering alerts when these conditions are met. Here's a breakdown of the various sections and options available when configuring a Trace-based alert:

## Step 1: Define the Trace Metric

In this step, you use the [Traces Query Builder](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/#logs-and-traces-query-builder)
to perform operations on your Traces to define conditions based on traces data. Some of the fields that are available in Traces Query Builder includes

- **Traces**: A field to filter the trace data to monitor. 

- **Aggregate Attribute**: Allows you to choose how the trace data should be aggregated. You can use functions like "Count"

- **Group by**: Lets you group trace data by different span/trace attributes, like "serviceName", "Status" or other custom attributes.

- **[Legend Format](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/#legend-format)**: An optional field to define the format for the legend in the visual representation of the alert.

- **Having**: Apply conditions to filter the results further based on aggregate value.

## Step 2: Define Alert Conditions
In this step, you set specific conditions for triggering the alert and determine the frequency of checking these conditions:

- **Send a notification when [A] is [above/below] the threshold in total during the last [X] mins**: A template to set the threshold for the alert, allowing you to define when the alert condition should be checked.

- **Alert Threshold**: A field to specify the threshold value for the alert condition.

- **More Options** :

    - **Run alert every [X mins]**: This option determines the frequency at which the alert condition is checked and notifications are sent.

    - **Send a notification if data is missing for [X] mins**: A field to specify if a notification should be sent when data is missing for a certain period.

## Step 3: Alert Configuration
In this step, you set the alert's metadata, including severity, name, and description:

### Severity
Set the severity level for the alert (e.g., "Warning" or "Critical").

### Alert Name
A field to name the alert for easy identification.

### Alert Description

Add a detailed description for the alert, explaining its purpose and trigger conditions.

Add a detailed description for the alert, explaining its purpose and trigger conditions.

You can incorporate result labels in the alert descriptions to make the alerts more informative:

### Test Notification
A button to test the alert to ensure that it works as expected.

## Examples

### 1. Alert when external API latency (P90) is over 1 second for last 5 mins

#### Here's a video tutorial for creating this alert:

#### Step 1: Write Query Builder query to define alert metric

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/alerts/traces/external-api-metric.png" alt="traces builder query for external API latency(p90)"/>
    <figcaption><i>External API latency (P90) query</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Using `externalHttpUrl` attribute we can filter specific external API endpoint and then set aggregation attribute to durationNano with P90 aggregation operation to plot a chart which measures 90th percentile latency. You can also choose `Avg` or anyother operation as aggregate operation depending on your needs.

    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/alerts/traces/external-api-metric-chart.png" alt="external API latency(p90) chart"/>

</figure>

<Admonition type="info">
Remember to select y-axis unit as nanoseconds as our aggregate key is durationNano.
</Admonition>
<br></br>
#### Step 2: Set alert conditions

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/product-features/alerts/traces/external-api-metric-condition.png" alt="external API latency(p90) condition"/>
    <figcaption><i>External API latency (P90) alert condition</i></figcaption>
</figure>

The condition is set to trigger a notification if the per-minute external API latency (P90) exceeds the threshold of 1 second all the time in the last five minutes.

#### Step 3: Set alert configuration

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>

At last configure the alert as `Warning`, add a name and notification channel.
