A Metric-based alert in SigNoz allows you to define conditions based on metric data and trigger alerts when these conditions are met. Here's a breakdown of the various sections and options available when configuring a Metric-based alert:

## Step 1: Define the Metric
In this step, you use the [Metrics Query Builder](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/#metrics-query-builder)
to choose the metric to monitor. Some of the fields that are available in Metrics Query Builder includes:

- **Metrics**: A field to select the specific metric you want to monitor (e.g., CPU usage, memory utilization). You can also choose an aggregation function like "Count," "Sum," or "Average."

- **WHERE**: A filter field to define specific conditions for the metric. You can apply logical operators like "IN," "NOT IN".

- **[Legend Format](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/#legend-format)**: An optional field to customize the legend's format in the visual representation of the alert.

- **Having**: Apply conditions to filter the results further based on aggregate value.

To know more about the functionalities of the Query Builder, checkout the [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/).

## Step 2: Define Alert Conditions
In this step, you define the specific conditions that trigger the alert and the notification frequency. The following fields are available:

- **Send a notification when [A] is [above/below] the threshold at least once during the last [X] mins**: A condition template to set the threshold for the alert, with options to define when and how often the condition should be checked.

- **Alert Threshold**: A field to set the threshold for the alert condition.

- **More Options** :

    - **Run alert every [X mins]**: This option determines the frequency at which the alert condition is checked and notifications are sent.

    - **Send a notification if data is missing for [X] mins**: A field to specify if a notification should be sent when data is missing for a certain period.

## Step 3: Alert Configuration
This step focuses on setting alert properties like severity, description, and other metadata. The following fields are available:

- **Severity**: Set the severity level for the alert (e.g., "Warning", "Critical" etc.).

- **Alert Name**: A field to name the alert for easy identification.

- **Alert Description**: A field for adding a detailed description of the alert, explaining what it monitors and under what conditions it is triggered.

- **Labels**: A field to add labels or tags to the alert for categorization.

- **Notification channels**: A field to choose the notification channels from those configured in the Alert Channel settings.

- **Test Notification**: A button to test the alert to ensure that it works as expected.

### Result labels in alert description

You can incorporate result labels in the alert descriptions to make the alerts more informative:

**Syntax**: Use `{{.Labels.<label-name>}}` to insert label values. 

**Example**: If you have a query that returns the label `service_name` then to use it in the alert description, you will use `{{.Labels.service_name}}`which creates an alert that is specific to the particular service.


## Example

An example Metrics-based alert could be set to trigger when errors go above a certain percentage:

- **Y-axis unit**: Percent(0 - 100)
- **Query A**: Total Calls with Error
- **Query B**: Total Calls 
- **Function**: A*100/B
- **Alert Threshold**: Above 0 within 5 minutes
- **Run alert every**: 1 minute
- **Send a notification if data is missing for** 5 minutes
- **Severity**: "Critical"
- **Alert Name**: "Error Percentage Alert"
- **Alert Description**: "This alert triggers when the Error percentage > 5%."
- **label**: `error percentage`
- **Notification Channels**: signoz-slack-alerts (Slack channel)
