# Creating Alerts based on Apdex Score

Apdex stands for Application Performance Index. It is a industry standard way to measuring the end user’s satisfaction based on the response times of the requests made by their applications and services, in comparison to a pre-determined threshold `T`.

Each request can be put into one of these three categories:

1. `Satisfactory` - The requests which were completed within the threshold time `T`
2. `Tolerated` - The requests which were completed within time greater than `T` but less than `4T`
3. `Frustrated` - The request either took greater than `4T` time to complete or resulted in an error.

An Apdex score is the ratio of the total acceptable requests (`Satisfactory` + `Tolerated`) to the total requests made.

`Apdex Score = (A + 0.5 * B)/C`

where 

`A` = number of satisfactory requests

`B` = number of tolerated requests

`C` = total number of requests

### Calculating score from metrics

In SigNoz, Apdex can be derived from histogram metrics like `http.server.duration.bucket`, which tracks request durations. The histogram uses upper-bound filters `le` to count requests below specific time thresholds.

The `le` (less than or equal) label represents the upper bound of a latency bucket. Every time a request completes, it's counted into all buckets where its duration is less than or equal to the bucket's upper bound.

For example, if a request takes 250ms to complete, it will be counted in:

- `le = 300`
- `le = 500`
- `le = 1000`, and so on

This cumulative structure means each `le` value contains all requests less than or equal to that time.

### Creating an Alert for Apdex Score

We can create an alert for evaluating Apdex score using a PromQL Query.

Let’s assume our threshold to be 2000 ms.

The written PromQL Query for the alert is:

```tsx
 ((sum(rate({"http.server.duration.bucket","le"="250"}[5m])) by ("service.name")) + (( sum(rate({"http.server.duration.bucket","le"="1000"}[5m])) by ("service.name")) -  (sum(rate({"http.server.duration.bucket","le"="250"}[5m])) by ("service.name")))*0.5) / (sum(rate({"http.server.duration.count"}[5m])) by ("service.name"))
```

The query can be broken into 3 parts:

1. `Satisfied Requests` - Requests that were completed within 250ms
    
    ```tsx
    sum(rate({"http.server.duration.bucket","le"="250"}[5m])) by ("[service.name](http://service.name/)")
    ```
    
2. `Tolerating Requet` - Requests that were were completed within 250ms to 1000ms.
    
    i.e. Requests completed within 1000ms - Requests completed within 250ms
    
    ```tsx
    (sum(rate({"http.server.duration.bucket","le"="1000"}[5m])) by ("service.name"))
    -
    (sum(rate({"http.server.duration.bucket","le"="250"}[5m])) by ("service.name"))
    ```
    
3. `Total Requests`
    
    ```tsx
    sum(rate({"http.server.duration.count"}[5m])) by ("service.name")
    ```
    

So the Apdex score becomes:

`Satisfied Requests` + (`Total Requests` * 0.5) / `Total Requests`

An Apdex score of 0.8 is consider good. So we can configure our alert to trigger whenever the value crossed the threshold of 0.8 during the last 5 minutes.
