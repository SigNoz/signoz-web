import SigNozCloud from '@/components/shared/signoz-cloud.mdx'

<SigNozCloud />

## Prerequisite

- Self-Hosted [SigNoz installed](https://signoz.io/docs/install/docker/) 
- Change directory to `deploy/docker-swarm`

Once you have successfully installed SigNoz on Docker Swarm, the following sections provide an overview of the activities that are required to successfully operate SigNoz.

## Stop/Start SigNoz Cluster

To stop SigNoz cluster:

```bash
docker service scale signoz_otel-collector=0 signoz_alertmanager=0 signoz_query-service=0 signoz_schema-migrator=0 signoz_init-clickhouse=0 signoz_clickhouse=0 signoz_zookeeper-1=0
```

To start/resume SigNoz cluster:

```bash
docker stack deploy --prune -d -c docker-compose.yaml signoz
```

<Admonition>
The newly created SigNoz cluster should mount on the existing local path in the node.
</Admonition>


## Uninstall SigNoz Cluster

To delete/uninstall SigNoz cluster:

```bash
docker stack rm signoz
```
