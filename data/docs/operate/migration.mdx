When upgrading across multiple SigNoz versions, you may encounter **required upgrade stops**. These are particular versions you must upgrade to before continuing, mainly due to breaking changes or key database schema updates included in those releases.

- **Required upgrade stops** include critical schema migrations or breaking change adjustments.
- At each stop:
  1. Follow the specific upgrade guide.
  2. **Wait** until all background migrations are finished.
  3. Proceed to the next checkpoint.
- Skipping a required stop may cause an inconsistent state or upgrade failure.

> **Example:** To upgrade from **v0.8.2** to **v0.10.0**:
> 1. Migrate to **v0.9**, wait until it completes.
> 2. Then upgrade to **v0.10**.
