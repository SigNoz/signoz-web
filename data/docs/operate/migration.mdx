When upgrading across several SigNoz versions, you may encounter **required upgrade stops**. These are specific versions you must upgrade to before proceeding further, often due to breaking changes or important database schema updates included in those releases.

- **Required upgrade stops** bundle critical schema migrations or breaking-change adjustments.  
- At each stop:
  1. Follow the guide for each upgrade
  2. **Wait** until all background migrations finish.  
  3. Move on to the next checkpoint.  
- Skipping a required stop can lead to inconsistent state or upgrade failures.

> **Example:** To go from **v0.8.2** â†’ **v0.10.0**:  
> 1. Migrate to **v0.9**, wait for it to complete.  
> 2. Then migrate to **v0.10**.
