You can configure for SigNoz with different options.

If no configuration for an option is set, then the default value as described is applied.

## Environment Variables for Configuration

When using SigNoz, there are various environment variables you can set to configure your SigNoz cluster.

Here is a comprehensive list of all of them. However, for general use, you most likely do not have to worry about most of these.

### Query Service

### Otel Collector

Otel Collector supports multiple combination of options.
Using the configuration file, you can pass `receivers`, `processors`, `extensions`, `exporters` and `service` as per your requirements.
You can find the complete otel collector configuration in the [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/).

By default, SigNoz runs with [this default Otel Collector configuration](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/main/deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/otel-collector-config.yaml).

For any configuration changes in **Docker**, you would have to update `/deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/otel-collector-config.yaml` and bring up Otel Collector.
