## Uninstall SigNoz

1. To uninstall/delete the `<release-name>` resources:

```bash
helm -n <namespace> uninstall "<release-name>"
```

See the [Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for documentation on the helm uninstall command.

2. The command above removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release except for ClickHouse CRD resources.
To delete resources accociated with the `ClickHouseInstallations` CRD:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> patch \
  clickhouseinstallations.clickhouse.altinity.com/<release-name>-clickhouse \
  -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
```

3. Deletion of the StatefulSet doesn't cascade to deleting associated PVCs. To delete them:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace>  delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<release-name>
```

4. Delete the namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace <namespace> 
```
