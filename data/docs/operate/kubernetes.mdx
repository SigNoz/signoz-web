## Upgrade SigNoz

<Admonition type="info">
Replace `<release-name>` and `<namespace>` from the instructions below with appropriate
release name and namespace respectively.
</Admonition>

Use the steps below to upgrade to the latest version:

1. Fetch the latest chart information from the Helm repositories
    ```bash
    helm repo update
    ```

2. Upgrade to the latest available version of the chart
    ```bash
    helm -n <namespace> upgrade <release-name> signoz/signoz
    ```

<UpgradeInfo/>

In case you wish to upgrade the SigNoz cluster to a specific version,
follow the steps below:

1. List the available SigNoz Helm charts with their version and supported app version.
    ```bash
    helm search repo signoz --versions
    ```

    The output should look similar to the following:
    ```output
    NAME               	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
    signoz/signoz      	0.2.5        	0.10.2     	SigNoz Observability Platform Helm Chart
    signoz/signoz      	0.2.3        	0.10.1     	SigNoz Observability Platform Helm Chart
    signoz/signoz      	0.2.2        	0.10.0     	SigNoz Observability Platform Helm Chart
    signoz/signoz      	0.2.1        	0.10.0     	SigNoz Observability Platform Helm Chart
    signoz/signoz      	0.2.0        	0.10.0     	SigNoz Observability Platform Helm Chart
    signoz/signoz      	0.1.4        	0.9.2      	SigNoz Observability Platform Helm Chart
    signoz/clickhouse  	23.4.0       	22.4.5     	A Helm chart for ClickHouse
    signoz/clickhouse  	23.3.3       	22.4.5     	A Helm chart for ClickHouse
    ```

2. Run the following command to install the chart version `0.2.5` running SigNoz
version `0.10.2` with the release name `<release-name>` and namespace `<namespace>`:

    ```bash
    helm -n <namespace> upgrade <release-name> signoz/signoz --version 0.2.5
    ```

See the [Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for documentation on the helm upgrade command.

<UpgradeWarning/>

## Uninstall SigNoz

1. To uninstall/delete the `<release-name>` resources:

```bash
helm -n <namespace> uninstall "<release-name>"
```

See the [Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for documentation on the helm uninstall command.

2. The command above removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release except for ClickHouse CRD resources.
To delete resources accociated with the `ClickHouseInstallations` CRD:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> patch \
  clickhouseinstallations.clickhouse.altinity.com/<release-name>-clickhouse \
  -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
```

3. Deletion of the StatefulSet doesn't cascade to deleting associated PVCs. To delete them:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace>  delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<release-name>
```

4. Delete the namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace <namespace> 
```
