# Upgrade to v0.37 from earlier versions

## Removal of `otel-collector-metrics` container

The docker deployments of SigNoz has been simplified by removing the `otel-collector-metrics` container. The necessary metrics are now collected by the `otel-collector` container itself. In the past, the `otel-collector-metrics` container was used to scrape span metrics from the `otel-collector`. This container is no longer needed and has been removed.

### How to upgrade if you are using `otel-collector-metrics` to scrape your metrics

If you are using `otel-collector-metrics` to scrape your metrics, you can use the `otel-collector` container to scrape your metrics. You can do this by moving the scrape jobs from `otel-collector-metrics` to `otel-collector`. You can find the `prometheus` receiver configuration in the `otel-collector` [here](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/be6bca3717152a54e889457f0d9b742399b6724d/deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/otel-collector-config.yaml#L50-L61)

#### Example

If you have a scrape job like this in your `otel-collector-metrics` container

```yaml
...
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'my-job'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:42069']
...
```

You can move it to the `otel-collector` container like this

```yaml
...
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: otel-collector
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:8888']
        - job_name: 'my-job'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:42069']
...
```
In case of **Docker Swarm** cluster with **more than one node**, you will have to create new collector service with the prometheus receiver and scrape configs to ensure no redundant metrics data.
### How to continue using `otel-collector-metrics`

This is not recommended as the `otel-collector-metrics` container has been removed. However, you may have a use case where you want to continue using the `otel-collector-metrics` container. This can create merge conflicts when you upgrade SigNoz. So it is recommended to make a copy of the deployment files before upgrading. You can use the `otel-collector-metrics` container from the `0.36` release to continue using it.
