Upgrade to **v0.86.0** is a mandatory step because this release includes important SQL migrations. These migrations must be completed before upgrading to later versions, especially those that require dot metrics migrations. Skipping this step may result in upgrade issues.

## Upgrade Instructions

1. **Follow the platform-specific upgrade instructions** for your deployment:
   - [Docker Standalone](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/migration/upgrade-standard/#docker-standalonee)
   - [Docker Swarm](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/migration/upgrade-standard/#docker-swarm-cluster)
   - [Kubernetes](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/migration/upgrade-standard/#kubernetes-deployment)
   - [Linux](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/migration/upgrade-standard/#linux-binary-installation)

2. **Use the `0.86.0` images** for all SigNoz component during the upgrade, you can keep the other components such as schema-migrator, signoz-otel-collector images as it is.

3. **No manual SQL migrations are required**. All necessary database migrations will run automatically as part of the upgrade process.
