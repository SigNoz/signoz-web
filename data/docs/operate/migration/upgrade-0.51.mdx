title: Upgrade to v0.51 from SigNoz versions older than v0.49.0
---

If you are upgrading from SigNoz version < v0.49.0 directly to version >= 0.51.0 please follow this guide.

* Exec into the ClickHouse container.

   On Docker:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it signoz-clickhouse bash
   ```

   On Kubernetes:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n platform exec -it pod/chi-signoz-cluster-0-0-0 -- bash
   ```
* Start the ClickHouse client by running `clickhouse client`
* Drop the body index 
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE signoz_logs.logs ON CLUSTER {{.SIGNOZ_CLUSTER}} DROP INDEX IF EXISTS body_idx
   ```
   Don't worry if the query timeout's, it will keep running in the background, you can proceed to the next step and wait.

* Wait for the mutation to complete, you can check by running the below command
   ```sql
   select * from system.mutations where is_done=0;
   ```
   Wait until the `DROP INDEX` mutation is complete. If the above query return's empty result you can proceed to the next step.
* Add the new body index
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE signoz_logs.logs ON CLUSTER {{.SIGNOZ_CLUSTER}} ADD INDEX IF NOT EXISTS body_idx lower(body) TYPE ngrambf_v1(4, 60000, 5, 0) GRANULARITY 1
   ```
