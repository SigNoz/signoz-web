title: Upgrade to v0.12 from earlier versions
---

## Features of this release 
v0.12 introduces distributed clickhouse setup. 


## After upgrading to v0.12

### Querying distributed tables
The new distributed tables in clickhouse have been named by prefixing `distributed_` to existing single shard table names. If you have used clickhouse queries in dashboard or alerts, you would need to update the queries with the new table names. Eg, `signoz_index_v2` now corresponds to the table of a single shard. To query all the shards, query against `distributed_signoz_index_v2`. 

The old table names will continue to work for single node installations as long as you work with a single shard. We recommend changing table names at the earliest to make future upgrade to distributed setup easier. 

For detailed instructions to include additional shards, go to
[Distributed ClickHouse documentation page](/docs/operate/clickhouse/distributed-clickhouse/).
