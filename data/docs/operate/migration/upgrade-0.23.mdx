# Upgrade to v0.23 from earlier versions (Kubernetes)

In the SigNoz version `>=0.23` i.e. SigNoz chart version `>=0.19.0`, [altinity/clickhouse-operator][1]
is upgraded from version `0.19.1` to `0.21.2`.

This upgrade brings a lot of improvements in the ClickHouse cluster management with
the updated operator. It resolves the previously seen `Out of Sync` issue of ArgoCD.
Henceforth, official support for ArgoCD by SigNoz is added.

No special steps are required for **Docker Standalone** and **Docker Swarm** deployments.

## Steps to Upgrade 

In order for keeping the ClickHouse Operator and ClickHouse cluster in sync,
please run the following commands before upgrading SigNoz chart to `>=0.19.0`.

```bash
SIGNOZ_CHART_VERSION="0.19.0"

kubectl apply \
    -f https://github.com/SigNoz/charts/raw/signoz-${SIGNOZ_CHART_VERSION}/charts/clickhouse/crds/clickhouseinstallations.clickhouse.altinity.com.yaml \
    -f https://github.com/SigNoz/charts/raw/signoz-${SIGNOZ_CHART_VERSION}/charts/clickhouse/crds/clickhouseinstallationtemplates.clickhouse.altinity.com.yaml \
    -f https://github.com/SigNoz/charts/raw/signoz-${SIGNOZ_CHART_VERSION}/charts/clickhouse/crds/clickhouseoperatorconfigurations.clickhouse.altinity.com.yaml
```

You may see a warning like below:

```
Warning: resource customresourcedefinitions/clickhouseinstallations.clickhouse.altinity.com is missing the kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration annotation which is required by kubectl apply. kubectl apply should only be used on resources created declaratively by either kubectl create --save-config or kubectl apply. The missing annotation will be patched automatically.

```

This is expected and you can safely ignore it.

## Upgrade to v0.23

Now, you proceed with the upgrade to `>=v0.23` as per the [usual instructions for Kubernetes][2]

:::info
If you had single node ClickHouse cluster, you might see some downtime during the upgrade.
This is because the ClickHouse cluster is recreated with the new operator.
The downtime is usually less than 5 minutes.

However, telemetry data should be queued and ingested once the ClickHouse cluster is up.
