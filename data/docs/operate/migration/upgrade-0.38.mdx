# Upgrade to v0.38 from earlier versions

In the previous version of SigNoz `0.36` i.e. SigNoz chart version `0.32.0`, we have added support for dot(`.`) in attribute names.

This migration updates the dashboards and alerts to support the new format.

If you are using SigNoz version prior to `0.36` please make sure that migration [v0.36](/docs/operate/migration/upgrade-0.36.md) is successful before running this.

## Steps to run migration script:

## First upgrade to v0.38

Follow the platform specific instructions to upgrade to 0.38 and above.

- [Docker Standalone](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/docker-standalone/#upgrade)
- [Docker Swarm](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/docker-swarm/#upgrade)
- [Kubernetes](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/kubernetes/#upgrade)


### For Docker

Change the directory to SigNoz repo and run following commands:

```bash
cd deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup
```

```bash
docker run --name signoz-migrate-sqlite --network clickhouse-setup_default -it \
  -v $PWD/data/signoz/:/var/lib/signoz/ signoz/migrate:0.38 \
  --data_source=/var/lib/signoz/signoz.db \
  --host=clickhouse \
  --port=9000
```

Steps to check logs:

```bash
docker logs -f signoz-migrate-sqlite
```

In case of failure and have to run again, make sure to cleanup the container before running the migration script again.

```bash
docker stop signoz-migrate-sqlite

docker rm signoz-migrate-sqlite
```


### For Kubernetes

The steps for running the migration on kubernetes are :- 
1. Make sure you have latest chart information from the
  Helm repositories:

  ```bash
  helm repo update
  ```

2. Include the following in `deployment-override.yaml` file:
  
  ```yaml
  queryService:
    initContainers:
      migration:
        enabled: true
        image:
          registry: docker.io
          repository: signoz/migrate
          tag: 0.38
          pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        args:
          - "--data_source=/var/lib/signoz/signoz.db"
          - "--host=$(CLICKHOUSE_HOST)"
          - "--user=$(CLICKHOUSE_USER)"
          - "--password=$(CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD)"
          - "--port=$(CLICKHOUSE_PORT)"
  ```

  If you are using external ClickHouse replace the value of `host` and `port` along with the respective value of `user` and `password`

3. Run the following command to upgrade the chart:
  ```bash
  helm --namespace platform upgrade my-release signoz/signoz -f deployment-override.yaml
  ```
4. Check the logs of the migration container using:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs my-release-signoz-query-service-0 -n platform -c my-release-signoz-query-service-migration
  ```
5. Remove the init container added in step 1 if there are no errors in the step 4 and upgrade:
  ```bash
  helm --namespace platform upgrade my-release signoz/signoz -f deployment-override.yaml
  ```
