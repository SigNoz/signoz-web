title: Upgrade to v0.70 from earlier versions of SigNoz
---

If you are upgrading from SigNoz version < v0.70.0 directly to version >= 0.70.0 please follow this guide.

This upgrade is only for SigNoz installation in **Docker Standalone** and **Docker Swarm**.
If you are using **Kubernetes** deployment, you can skip this guide.

## Prerequisites

- You have an existing SigNoz installation with data.
- **Make sure you have sufficient free disk space** to backup your data.
  Preferably more than 50% free space of the total disk space.

If you do not wish to backup your data, you can bring down the running SigNoz installation,
delete the associated resources, and start with a fresh installation.

## Steps to Run the Migration Script

This guide is for migrating data from bind mount to **Docker Volume**.

### Docker Standalone

- Navigate to the volume migration script

  ```bash
  cd scripts/volume-migration
  ```

- Run the migration script

  ```bash
  ./migrate.sh -o migrate -d standalone -m all
  ```

  If you want to migrate only a specific component, you can replace `all`
  with the component name.
  
  For example, to migrate only the SQLite data, you can run:

  ```bash
  ./migrate.sh -o migrate -d standalone -m signoz
  ```

- After the migration is complete, verify that Docker volumes are created and
  you are able to see the old data using SigNoz UI

  ```bash
  docker volume ls
  ```

- (Optional) Delete the old bind mount data that is no longer needed.

  To delete the old bind mount data, run the following command:

  ```bash
  ./migrate.sh -o post-migrate -d standalone -m all
  ```

### Docker Swarm

In case of multi-node Swarm cluster, you need to run the migration script on each node.

You may see some errors in worker nodes, but you can ignore them.

- Navigate to the volume migration script

  ```bash
  cd scripts/volume-migration
  ```

- Run the migration script

  ```bash
  ./migrate.sh -o migrate -d swarm -m all
  ```

- After the migration is complete, verify that all the Docker volumes are created:

  ```bash
  docker volume ls
  ```

  You should see output similar to the following:

  ```
  local     signoz-alertmanager
  local     signoz-clickhouse
  local     signoz-sqlite
  local     signoz-zookeeper-1
  ```

- Make sure you are able to login in SigNoz UI and see the old data.

- (Optional) If you want to delete the old bind mount data that is no longer needed, you can run the following command:

  ```bash
  ./migrate.sh -o post-migrate -d swarm -m all
  ```

## Command-Line Interface (CLI) Options

There are some custom options which can be enabled based on different use cases.
All the options below are `optional`.

Options:

- `-d` : Deployment type (standalone, swarm)
- `-m` : Migration component (all, clickhouse, zookeeper, signoz, alertmanager)
- `-o` : Operation (migrate, post-migrate)
- `-p` : Signoz root directory - defaults to the root SigNoz directory wrt the script
- `-s` : Silent mode (true, false) - defaults to false
- `-h` : Show this help message
