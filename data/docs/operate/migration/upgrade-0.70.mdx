title: Upgrade to v0.70 from earlier versions of SigNoz
---

If you are upgrading from SigNoz version < v0.70.0 directly to version >= 0.70.0 please follow this guide.

This upgrade is only for SigNoz installation in **Docker Standalone** and **Docker Swarm**.
If you are using **Kubernetes** deployment, you can skip this guide.

## Steps to Run the Migration Script

This guide is for migrating data from bind mount to **Docker Volume**.

### Docker Standalone

- Navigate to the volume migration script

```bash
cd scripts/volume-migration
```

- Run the migration script

```bash
./migrate.sh -o migrate -d standalone -m all
```

- After the migration is complete, verify that you are able to see the old data using SigNoz UI

- If you want to delete the old bind mount data that is no longer needed, you can run the following command:

```bash
./migrate.sh -o post-migrate -d standalone -m all
```

### Docker Swarm

In case of multi-node Swarm cluster, you need to run the migration script on each node.
You may see some errors in worker nodes, but you can ignore them.

- Navigate to the volume migration script

```bash
cd scripts/volume-migration
```

- Run the migration script

```bash
./migrate.sh -o migrate -d swarm -m all
```

- After the migration is complete, verify that you are able to see the old data using SigNoz UI

- If you want to delete the old bind mount data that is no longer needed, you can run the following command:

```bash
./migrate.sh -o post-migrate -d swarm -m all
```
