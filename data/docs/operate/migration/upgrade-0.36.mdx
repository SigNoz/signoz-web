# Upgrade to v0.36 from earlier versions (Kubernetes)

In the SigNoz version `>=0.36` i.e. SigNoz chart version `>=0.32.0` , we have added support for dot(`.`) in attribute names.

Ex:- Previously `service.name` was stored and queried as `service_name` , after this upgrade `service.name` will be supported.


## Steps to run migration script:

:::note
It's recommended to run the migration script 10-15 mins after upgrading to `v0.36` . You can also run this migration script multiple times.
:::

## First upgrade to v0.36

Follow the platform specific instructions to upgrade to 0.36 and above.

Note that the past exceptions/error data will not be visible on the new application until you run the migration script.

- [Docker Standalone](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/docker-standalone/#upgrade)
- [Docker Swarm](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/docker-swarm/#upgrade)
- [Kubernetes](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/kubernetes/#upgrade)


### For Docker
```bash
docker run --name signoz-migrate --network clickhouse-setup_default \
  -it -d signoz/migrate:0.36 -host=clickhouse -port=9000
```

Steps to check logs:

```bash
docker logs -f signoz-migrate
```

In case of failure and have to run again, make sure to cleanup the container before running the migration script again.

```bash
docker stop signoz-migrate

docker rm signoz-migrate
```


### For Docker Swarm

For Swarm, you could follow similar step to that of [Docker](#docker). However,
you would need to expose clickhouse container ports to host machine and use
host machine IP i.e. `172.17.0.17` for `-host` flag instead of `clickhouse`.

If you do not want to change anything in the current signoz deployment or to
expose clickhouse ports even temporarily, you can go through following steps.

1. To download `migrate-v0.36` binary:

  ```bash
  wget https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz-db-migrations/releases/download/v0.36/migrate-v0.36-linux-amd64

  chmod +x migrate-v0.36-linux-amd64
  ```

2. To copy the binary in persistent volume path `/var/lib/clickhouse` in `clickhouse` container:

  ```bash
  docker cp migration-v0.36-linux-amd64 $(docker ps -q -f name=signoz_clickhouse):/var/lib/clickhouse/migrate-0.36
  ```

3. To exec into the `clickhouse` container:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f name=signoz_clickhouse) bash
  ```

4. Now, change directory to the `/var/lib/clickhouse` and run the migration script:

  ```bash
  cd /var/lib/clickhouse

  ./migration-0.36
  ```

5. At last, clean up the binary:

  ```bash
  rm migration-0.36
  ```


### For Kubernetes

```bash
RELEASE=my-release
ADMIN_PASSWORD=$(
  kubectl -n platform get clickhouseinstallations.clickhouse.altinity.com $RELEASE-clickhouse \
  -o jsonpath --template '{.spec.configuration.users.admin/password}'
)

kubectl -n platform run -i -t signoz-migrate --image=signoz/migrate:0.36 --restart='Never' \
  -- -host=$RELEASE-clickhouse -port=9000 -userName=admin -password=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

Steps to check logs:

```bash
kubectl -n platform logs -f signoz-migrate
```

In case of failure and have to run again, make sure to cleanup the pod before running the migration script again.

```bash
kubectl -n platform delete pod signoz-migrate
```


## In case of Upgrade Failure

1. Note the names of fields which were not migrated. ex:- `telemetry.sdk.name`
2. Exec into the clickhouse container and run `clickhouse client`.
3. Check the schema of the logs table `show create table signoz_logs.logs`
4. If `telemetry_sdk_name` column or `telemetry_sdk_name_idx` index is present you can delete them
   
  For deleting index 
    * `alter table signoz_logs.logs on cluster cluster drop index telemetry_sdk_name_idx`
  
  For deleting column 
    * `alter table signoz_logs.logs on cluster cluster drop column telemetry_sdk_name`
    * `alter table signoz_logs.distributed_logs on cluster cluster drop column telemetry_sdk_name`
5. Now from the UI, you can convert `telemetry.sdk.name` to selected field. 
6. If you still face issue, reach out to us at [Slack](https://signoz.io/slack).

## Command-Line Interface (CLI) Flags

There are some custom flags which can be enabled based on different use-cases.
All the flags below are `optional`.

Flags:

- `-port` : Specify port of clickhouse. `default=9000`
- `-host` : Specify host of clickhouse. `default=127.0.0.1`
- `-userName` : Specify user name of clickhouse. `default=default`
- `-password` : Specify password of clickhouse. `default=""`


## Updating Query Payload, Dashboards and Alerts
:::note
It's recommended to update Dashboards and Alerts after a few days of installing the release so that sufficient amount of newer data is ingested.
:::

If you've been using the SigNoz Query API, Dashboards, or Alerts with attributes that included a dot (.) but were converted to an underscore (_), they will continue to function for the next 45 days. However, it's essential to update these attributes to reflect the new format.

Ex:- 
* `service.name` was previously shown and stored as `service_name` . Now you can update it to use `service.name`
* `k8s.namespace.name` was previously shown and stored as `k8s_namespace_name` . Now you can update it to use `k8s.namespace.name`

For assistance in making these updates, please reach out to us via Intercom support or at cloud-support@signoz.io
