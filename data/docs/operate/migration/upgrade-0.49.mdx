title: Upgrade to v0.49 from earlier versions
---

In SigNoz version >= v0.36, support for `.` in log attribute names was added.
Before that, any `.` in log attribute names would get replaced by an `_`  
For example, the attribute `k8s.pod.name` would appear as `k8s_pod_name` in SigNoz

SigNoz versions < v0.49 have a measure in place to ensure log pipelines that were created
with filters based on attributes whose `.`s had been replaced with `_`s worked fine with raw
logs that had such attributes with `.`s in them instead of `_`s.  
So a pipeline with the filter `k8s_pod_name = test-pod` would work even though actual raw
logs being sent to SigNoz only had the attribute `k8s.pod.name = test-pod`

In SigNoz version >=v0.49 i.e. SigNoz chart version >=0.45.0, this measure is being removed.  
After this upgrade, any such pipelines that use filters based on attributes whose `.`s had
been replaced with `_`s will only work if the filters are updated to use `.` based names.  
So after this upgrade, any pipeline that had the filter `k8s_pod_name = test-pod`
will only work if the filter is updated to `k8s.pod.name = test-pod`

## Steps to Update Pipeline Filters If Needed

1. Navigate to the logs section in SigNoz by clicking on "Logs" in the sidebar
2. Navigate to log pipelines page by clicking on the "Pipelines" tab in the top bar.
3. Examine the filter expression of all of your pipelines.
4. If you have pipelines with filters that use attribute names containing `_`
   1. Enter edit mode by clicking the "Enter Edit Mode" button at the top right above the pipelines list.
   2. For each pipeline that has a filter that uses attribute names containing `_`
      1. Open the edit pipeline dialog by clicking the edit action (pen icon in actions column)
      2. If the "Filtered Logs Preview" section at the bottom of the dialog doesn't show any matched logs
         1. For each clause that uses an attribute with `_` in its name, try updating it to its `.` based name using the autocomplete, until the "Filtered Logs Preview" is no longer empty
            1. For example, replace `k8s_pod_name = test-pod` by `k8s.pod.name = test-pod`
         2. Click the "Update" button in the Edit Pipeline dialog to close it.
      3. If the pipeline filter did not need editing, close the dialog by clicking "Cancel" button at the bottom of the dialog.
   3. If you updated the filter for any of the pipelines, click the "Save Configuration" at the bottom right of the page
