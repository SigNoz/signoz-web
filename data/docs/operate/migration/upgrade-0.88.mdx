title: Upgrade to v0.88 from earlier versions of SigNoz
---

**Important: Dot Metrics Migration Required**

SigNoz v0.88 introduces a migration from normalized, underscore-based metric names (e.g., `system_memory_usage`) to unnormalized, dot-based metric names (e.g., `system.memory.usage`). 

This change aligns with OpenTelemetry semantic conventions and enables better namespacing and cross-signal compatibility.

For more details about this migration, see [this guide](https://signoz.io/guides/metrics-migration/).


Before or as part of upgrading to v0.88, you must migrate your existing alerts and dashboards to use the new dot-metrics format. Failing to do so may result in broken dashboards or alerts.

Please follow the [Dot Metrics Migration Guide](/docs/manage/administrator-guide/dot-metrics-migration) for detailed instructions and requirements.
