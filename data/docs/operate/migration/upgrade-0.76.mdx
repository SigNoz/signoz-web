title: Upgrade to v0.76 from earlier versions of SigNoz
---

If you are upgrading from SigNoz version < `v0.76.0` directly to version >= `v0.76.0`
and chart version < `0.74.0` to >= `0.74.0`, please follow this guide.

This upgrade is only for SigNoz installation in **Kubernetes**.

If you are using **Docker Standalone** or **Docker Swarm**, you can skip the
upgrade part of the migration guide, but only follow the steps to
cleanup unused volumes.

## Prerequisites

- You have an existing SigNoz installation in Kubernetes.
- `kubectl` command to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

<Admonition type="warning">
- Please ensure that you have a backup of your existing SQLite database.
  ```bash
  kubectl cp -n platform --retries=5 my-release-signoz-query-service-0:/var/lib/signoz/signoz.db ./backup-signoz.db
  ```
  Replace `platform` with the namespace where your SigNoz is installed.
  And `my-release-signoz-query-service-0` with the name of your `query-service` pod.

- If you do not wish to restore your SQLite data, you can directly upgrade
the helm release to the new version. Followed by
[deleting the old unused volumes](#optional-delete-the-old-unused-volumes).
</Admonition>

## Steps to Run the Migration

- 1. Verify that old `query-service` PVC exists.

  Run the following command to check if the old `query-service` PVC exists.

  ```bash
  kubectl get pvc -n platform -l app.kubernetes.io/component=query-service
  ```

  You should see output similar to the following:

  ```
  NAME                                   STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS   AGE
  signoz-db-my-release-signoz-query-service-0   Bound    pvc-c8a9f5e1-b4b9-4c9c-87fd-ecaf31c96d4d   1Gi        RWO            hostpath       <unset>                 179m
  ```

  **Notes**:
  - Replace `platform` with the namespace where your SigNoz is installed.
  - If you do not see any PVCs, you can skip the migration as the old
  `query-service` PVC is not present.

- 2. Create an init container under `signoz` section for migration.

  Add the following migration init container under `signoz` section in your `my-values.yaml` file.

  ```yaml
  signoz:
    initContainers:
      migration:
        enabled: true
        image:
          registry: docker.io
          repository: busybox
          tag: 1.35
        command:
          - /bin/sh
          - -c
          - |
            echo "Running migration..."
            cp -pv /var/lib/old-signoz/signoz.db /var/lib/signoz/signoz.db
            echo "Migration complete..."
        resources: {}
        additionalVolumes:
          - name: old-signoz-db
            persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: signoz-db-my-release-signoz-query-service-0
        additionalVolumeMounts:
          - name: old-signoz-db
            mountPath: /var/lib/old-signoz
  ```

  Note that the `claimName` is the name of the PVC for the old `query-service`
  i.e. `signoz-db-my-release-signoz-query-service-0`. Replace it with the name
  of the PVC for your release.

- 3. Fetch the latest SigNoz helm chart.

  ```bash
  helm repo add signoz https://signoz.github.io/signoz
  helm repo update signoz
  ```

- 4. Upgrade the helm release.

  ```bash
  helm upgrade --install signoz signoz/signoz --namespace platform --values my-values.yaml
  ```

  For more details on the SigNoz upgrades on Kubernetes, please refer to the
  [Operate SigNoz on Kubernetes guide][1].

- 5. Verify that the new SigNoz pods is running and healthy.

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n platform
  ```

  You should see output similar to the following:

  ```
  NAME                                                  READY   STATUS      RESTARTS       AGE    IP          NODE             NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES

  my-release-signoz-schema-migrator-sync-h8w6k          0/1     Completed   0              40m    10.1.7.82   docker-desktop   <none>           <none>
  my-release-zookeeper-0                                1/1     Running     0              3h5m   10.1.7.43   docker-desktop   <none>           <none>
  ```

  You should find a new SigNoz `my-release-signoz-0`.
  Also, you should see removal of the old pods associated to **query-service**,
  **alertmanager**, **frontend**, and **otel-collector-metrics**.

- 6. Disable the migration init container.

  Disable the migration init container by setting `enabled` to `false` in
  your `my-values.yaml` file.

  ```yaml
  signoz:
    initContainers:
      migration:
        enabled: false
  ```

  Apply the changes and restart the SigNoz pods.

  ```bash
  helm upgrade --install signoz signoz/signoz --namespace platform --values my-values.yaml
  ```

- 7. Verify that SQLite data is migrated.

  Open the SigNoz UI and check if you are able to login with your previous
  credentials.
  
  Followed by checking for your existing members, dashboards, alerts, and pipelines.

## (Optional) Delete the Old Unused Volumes

### Kubernetes

  To delete the old volumes:

  ```bash
  # Delete the query-service pvc
  kubectl delete pvc -n platform -l app.kubernetes.io/component=query-service

  # Delete the alertmanager pvc
  kubectl delete pvc -n platform -l app.kubernetes.io/component=alertmanager
  ```

### Docker Standalone

To delete the old volume:

```bash
docker volume rm signoz-alertmanager
```

### Docker Swarm

To delete the old volume:

```bash
docker volume rm signoz-alertmanager
```
