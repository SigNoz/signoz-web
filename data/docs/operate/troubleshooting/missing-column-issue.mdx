## Missing Columns Issue

In case you are using signoz version `0.27` or newer and in the past you ran the migration `0.27` 
You may face missing columns issue if you are using distributed clickhouse with multiple shards.

To solve this issue, exec into all the shards and follow the steps below:

```sql
show create table signoz_logs.distributed_logs
```

If in one shard the name of a column is `host_name` and 
in other shard the name is `attribute_string_host_name` then run the following command

```sql
alter table signoz_logs.distributed_logs on cluster cluster rename column if exists host_name to attribute_string_host_name
```

Run the above command for all the column names which were not migrated.
