## Prerequisite

- Self-Hosted [SigNoz installed](https://signoz.io/docs/install/docker/) 

Once you have successfully installed SigNoz on Docker Standalone, the following sections provide an overview of the activities that are required to successfully operate SigNoz.

## Stop/Start SigNoz Cluster

To stop SigNoz cluster:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml stop
```

To start/resume SigNoz cluster:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

<Admonition>
The stopped SigNoz cluster should resume and mount to the existing docker volumes.

## Upgrade SigNoz Cluster

Use the commands below to sync to the [latest](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/latest) release.

1. Checkout to `main` branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```

2. Pull the `latest` changes from the [SigNoz GitHub repository](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz):
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

3. Go to `deploy` folder and run the `install.sh` script:
    ```bash
    cd deploy && ./install.sh
    ```

In case you wish to upgrade the SigNoz cluster to a specific version, let's say `v0.6.2`, follow the steps below:

1. Checkout to the [v0.6.2](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.6.2) tag:
    ```bash
    git checkout v0.6.2
    ```

2. Go to `deploy` folder and run the `install.sh` script:
    ```bash
    cd deploy && ./install.sh
    ```

<UpgradeWarning/>

## Uninstall SigNoz Cluster

Enter the following command to uninstall SigNoz:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml down -v
```

## Running SigNoz without Sample Application

By default, `docker-compose.yaml` includes a sample application setup.
To run SigNoz without the sample application, instead of using `docker-compose.yaml`, use `docker-compose-minimal.yaml` in all previously mentioned commands.

For example,
```bash
docker compose -f docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose-minimal.yaml up -d
```

If you still see the HotROD services on the dashboard, wait for a few minutes, and the changes will be reflected.
