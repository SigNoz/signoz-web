Once you have successfully installed SigNoz on Docker Standalone, the following sections provide an overview of the activities that are required to successfully operate SigNoz.

## Stop/Start SigNoz Cluster

To stop SigNoz cluster:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml stop
```

To start/resume SigNoz cluster:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

<Admonition>
The stopped SigNoz cluster should resume and mount to the existing docker volumes.

## Upgrade SigNoz Cluster

Use the commands below to sync to the [latest](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/latest) release.

1. Checkout to `main` branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```

2. Pull the `latest` changes from the [SigNoz GitHub repository](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz):
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

3. Go to `deploy` folder and run the `install.sh` script:
    ```bash
    cd deploy && ./install.sh
    ```

In case you wish to upgrade the SigNoz cluster to a specific version, let's say `v0.6.2`, follow the steps below:

1. Checkout to the [v0.6.2](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.6.2) tag:
    ```bash
    git checkout v0.6.2
    ```

2. Go to `deploy` folder and run the `install.sh` script:
    ```bash
    cd deploy && ./install.sh
    ```

## Uninstall SigNoz Cluster

Enter the following command to uninstall SigNoz:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml down -v
```

## Remove the Sample Application from SigNoz Dashboard

Follow the steps in this section to remove the sample application that comes installed with SigNoz:

1. From the directory in which you installed SigNoz, open Docker Compose file `deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml` in a plain-text editor. 

2. Comment out or remove the `services.hotrod` and `services.load-hotrod` sections:

  ![Remove the sample application on Docker Standalone](/img/docker-standalone-remove-the-sample-application.webp)

3. Move into the `deploy` directory and run the `install.sh` script again:

    ```bash
    cd deploy && ./install.sh
    ```

<Admonition>
If you still see the HotROD services on the dashboard, just wait for a few minutes and the changes will reflect.
