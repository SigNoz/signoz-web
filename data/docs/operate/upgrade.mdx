## Upgrade Path Tool

When upgrading across multiple SigNoz versions, you may encounter **required upgrade stops**. These are particular versions you must upgrade to before continuing, mainly due to breaking changes or key database schema updates included in those releases.

- **Required upgrade stops** include critical schema migrations or breaking change adjustments.
- At each stop:
  1. Follow the specific upgrade guide.
  2. **Wait** until all background migrations are finished.
  3. Proceed to the next checkpoint.
- Skipping a required stop may cause an inconsistent state or upgrade failure.

> **Example:** To upgrade from **v0.8.2** to **v0.10.0**:
> 1. Migrate to **v0.9**, wait until it completes.
> 2. Then upgrade to **v0.10**.


### Simplify with our Upgrade Path Tool

To eliminate guesswork, our interactive Upgrade Path Tool automatically generates the correct sequence of steps for you. It identifies all required stops, warns about breaking changes, and links to the relevant documentation, making it essential for a safe upgrade.
