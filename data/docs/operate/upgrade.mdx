- **Upgrade guides** are structured by version, indicating any necessary migration steps or breaking changes.
- **Refer to the upgrade path table below** to see if your upgrade requires intermediate steps, especially if you are skipping multiple versions.
- Follow the linked documentation for each version in your upgrade pathway for detailed instructions.


## Release Cycle

SigNoz follows a regular schedule for new releases, with additional bug fixes and security patches when necessary.

| Release Type         | Frequency                | Example Versions         | Notes                                                      |

## Upgrade Path

When upgrading across multiple SigNoz versions, you may encounter **required upgrade stops**. These are particular versions you must upgrade to before continuing, mainly due to breaking changes or key database schema updates included in those releases.

- **Required upgrade stops** include critical schema migrations or breaking change adjustments.
- At each stop:
  1. Follow the specific upgrade guide.
  2. **Wait** until all background migrations are finished.
  3. Proceed to the next checkpoint.
- Skipping a required stop may cause an inconsistent state or upgrade failure.

> **Example:** To upgrade from **v0.8.2** to **v0.10.0**:
> 1. Migrate to **v0.9**, wait until it completes.
> 2. Then upgrade to **v0.10**.

To plan your upgrade, find your current version in the table below and note any necessary upgrade steps along your path.
