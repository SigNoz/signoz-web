It is recommended to use the ClickHouse instance that is deployed along with Signoz.
However, if you want to use an external ClickHouse instance, you can do so by relevant
instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Must have at least one Zookeeper instance
- Distributed cluster named `cluster` set up required: [clickhouse-cluster.xml][3]
- User credentaials passed must have enough privileges to create/manage databases and tables
- Secure connection is not supported between Signoz and ClickHouse yet
- (Optional) UDF script and histogram quantile binary required: [custom-function.xml][1]
and [histogramQuantile binary][2]

:::info
The name of the cluster must be `cluster` as it is hardcoded in the SigNoz OtelCollector
migration files due to the limitations of `golang-migrate` library.
:::

## Setting up ClickHouse

1. Run at least an instance of Zookeeper.
2. Create configuration for distributed cluster named `cluster` as described in
    [clickhouse-cluster.xml][3] and include it in `/etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/`.
3. Include Zookeeper information in above [clickhouse-cluster.xml][3] file as well.
4. (Optional) Below steps are only required if you want to use _histogram quantile_ 
    functions using **Query Builder**.
    - Include [custom function configuration][1] in the `/etc/clickhouse-server/` directory.
    - Include [histogram quantile binary][2] in the `/var/lib/clickhouse/user_scripts/` directory.
5. Run at least an instance of ClickHouse with the above configuration.

## For Docker and Docker Swarm Users

In Docker and Docker Swarm, we will be modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file to use an
external ClickHouse.

1. Comment out `clickhouse` and `zookeeper` services in `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Comment out `x-clickhouse-defaults` and `x-clickhouse-depend` sections
    in `docker-compose.yml`.
3. Replace `clickhouse:9000` with relavant ClickHouse endpoint and TCP port in the files below:
    - `docker-compose.yaml`
    - `otel-collector-config.yaml`
    - `prometheus-config.yml`
4. Start SigNoz using relevant instructions.

## For Kubernetes Users

In Kubernetes, we will update `override-values.yaml` file to use an external ClickHouse.

At first, we will disable the default ClickHouse instance by setting `clickhouse.enabled` to `false`.
Then, we will include the external ClickHouse information in the `externalClickhouse` section.

_override-values.yaml_

```yaml
clickhouse:
  enabled: false

externalClickhouse:
  host: <clickhouse-endpoint>
  httpPort: 8123
  tcpPort: 9000
  cluster: cluster
  secure: false
  user: <ch-user>
  password: <ch-password>
```

To install SigNoz using the above configuration, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl create namespace platform
helm --namespace platform install my-release signoz/signoz -f override-values.yaml
```
