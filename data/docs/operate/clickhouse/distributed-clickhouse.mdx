## Prerequisites

- SigNoz version >= 0.42
- SigNoz OtelCollector and Schema Migrator >= 0.88.19
- SigNoz Chart >= 0.38.1
- Zookeeper (or ClickHouse Keeper) is mandatory for running a distributed
ClickHouse cluster
- 3 nodes Zookeeper cluster recommended for distributed ClickHouse cluster
with production environment, while single instance of Zookeeper should suffice for
development environment

## Distributed ClickHouse Setup for SigNoz

Basically, distributed ClickHouse cluster consists of the following:

- More than one clickhouse shard/replica instances
- All clickhouse server information included in `remote_servers` clickhouse config as shards
- Zookeeper cluster with 1 or 3 nodes, and including it in `zookeeper` clickhouse config

Follow the instructions in the respective sections below to set up distributed
clickhouse with multiple shards/replicas for your SigNoz cluster.
