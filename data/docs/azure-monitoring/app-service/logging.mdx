title: App Service Logging

## Overview
The following categories of App Service Logs are available to export to Storage Account or EventHub. 

- HTTP logs
- App Service Console Logs
- App Service Application Logs
- Access Audit Logs
- IPSecurity Audit logs
- App Service Platform logs

Although, the application logs could be sent directly in the Application Level using a Opentelemetry Log Appender, this might not be an ideal solution for legacy software or micro-services model. Itâ€™s easier to do centralised logging for both application logs, system logs and SIEM Audit logs.

### Prerequisites

- [EventHub Setup](../../bootstrapping/data-ingestion)
- [Central Collector Setup](../../bootstrapping/collector-setup)

## Setup

1. Navigate to your App Service in the Azure portal
2. Search for "Diagnostic settings" in the left navigation menu
3. Click on "Add Diagnostic Setting"
    <figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img
        src="/img/docs/azure-monitoring/app-svc-diag-settings.webp"
        alt="App Service Diagnostic Settings"
    />
    <figcaption>
    <i>
    App Service Diagnostic Settings
    </i>
    </figcaption>
    </figure>
4. Select the desired log categories to export:
    - HTTP logs
    - App Service Console Logs
    - App Service Application Logs
    - Access Audit Logs
    - IPSecurity Audit logs
    - App Service Platform logs
    <figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img
        src="/img/docs/azure-monitoring/app-svc-diag-configuration.webp"
        alt="App Service Diagnostic Configuration"
    />
    <figcaption>
    <i>
    App Service Diagnostic Configuration
    </i>
    </figcaption>
    </figure>
5. Configure the destination details as "**Stream to an Event Hub**" and select the Event Hub namespace and Event Hub name created during the [EventHub Setup](../../bootstrapping/data-ingestion)
6. Save the diagnostic settings

That's it! You have successfully set up logging for your Azure App Service.
