## QuickStart

To monitor your **MySQL Flexible Server's** system metrics like CPU Usage, Memory Usage, and Storage with **SigNoz**, configure **Diagnostic Settings** in Azure to export metrics and logs to **Event Hub**, and set up the **OpenTelemetry Collector** to pull data from Event Hub and send it to SigNoz.

## Overview

In this guide, you'll learn how to monitor **MySQL Flexible Server** system metrics using SigNoz. This is achieved by pushing telemetry data to **Azure Event Hub** and configuring the **Central Collector (OpenTelemetry Collector)** to receive and forward it to SigNoz.

> ⚠️ Note: MySQL Flexible Server **does not support SQL Monitoring Profile**. Instead, it supports Diagnostic Settings to export logs and metrics to an Event Hub.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following are set up:

1. An Azure subscription with a running **MySQL Flexible Server**
2. [Central Collector Setup](../bootstrapping/collector-setup)
3. A **Diagnostic Settings** configuration in Azure for your MySQL Flexible Server that sends metrics/logs to an **Event Hub**

## Setup

Once prerequisites are in place, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Enable Diagnostic Settings for MySQL Flexible Server

1. Go to your **MySQL Flexible Server** resource in Azure.
2. Select **Diagnostic Settings**.
3. Create a new diagnostic setting:
   - Choose **Metrics** and/or **Logs** (based on what you want to monitor)
   - Destination: **Stream to an Event Hub**
   - Select an existing **Event Hub Namespace** and **Event Hub Name** or create one.
   - Save the diagnostic setting.

### Step 2: Update Central Collector to Pull from Event Hub

1. In your `otel-collector-config.yaml`, update the **metrics pipeline** or **logs pipeline** to include the `azureeventhub` receiver.
2. A sample snippet:
    ```yaml
    receivers:
      azureeventhub:
        connection_string: "<EVENT_HUB_CONNECTION_STRING>"
        format: "azure"

    processors:
      batch:

    exporters:
      otlp:
        endpoint: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
        tls:
          insecure: false
        headers:
          "signoz-ingestion-key": "<ingestion-key>"

    service:
      pipelines:
        metrics:
          receivers: [azureeventhub]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [otlp]
        logs:
          receivers: [azureeventhub]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [otlp]
    ```

3. Restart the Central Collector to apply the changes.

## Troubleshooting

1. Ensure Event Hub is receiving data (check message count/metrics in Event Hub).
2. Verify the Central Collector is running and has the correct `connection_string`.
3. Make sure the SigNoz collector endpoint is accessible and listening.
4. Check for errors in Central Collector logs for misconfigurations.
