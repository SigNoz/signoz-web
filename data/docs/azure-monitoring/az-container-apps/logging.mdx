title: Container App Logging

## Overview
The following categories of Container Apps Logs are available to export to Storage Account or EventHub. 

 - Container App console logs
 - Container App system logs
 - Spring App console logs

Although, the application logs could be sent directly in the Application Level using a OpenTelemetry Log Appender, this might not be an ideal solution for legacy software or micro-services model. Itâ€™s easier to do centralised logging for both application logs, system logs and SIEM Audit logs.

### Prerequisites

- [EventHub Setup](../../bootstrapping/data-ingestion)
- [Central Collector Setup](../../bootstrapping/collector-setup)

## Setup

1. Navigate to your Container Apps in the Azure portal
2. Click on "Container Apps Environment" to open the Container Apps Environment
3. Search for "Diagnostic settings" in the left navigation menu
4. Click on "Add Diagnostic Setting"
5. Select the desired log categories to export:
    - Container App console logs
    - Container App system logs
    - Spring App console logs
