### Overview

This documentation guides you through integrating AWS EC2 infrastructure metrics into SigNoz using the Hostmetrics receiver in OpenTelemetry Collector. 
The Hostmetrics receiver is designed to collect metrics about the host system from various sources. It supports various scrapers for collecting different metrics, 
including CPU, disk, load, filesystem, memory, network, paging, and process metrics.
