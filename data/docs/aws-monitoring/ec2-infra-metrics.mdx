### Overview

This documentation guides you through integrating AWS EC2 infrastructure metrics into SigNoz using the Hostmetrics receiver in OpenTelemetry Collector. The Hostmetrics receiver is designed to collect metrics about the host system from various sources. It supports various scrapers for collecting different metrics, including CPU, disk, load, filesystem, memory, network, paging, and process metrics.

### Prerequisites

- An EC2 instance
- A [SigNoz Cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/) account

### Configuring Hostmetrics Receiver

To see your infrastructure metrics in SigNoz, you need to configure the hostmetrics receiver and create a HostMetrics Dashboard. Follow [this documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/hostmetrics/) to configure hostmetrics receiver and creating the Hostmetrics Dashboard.


### Final Output

After setting up your Hostmetrics Dashboard, here's what it might look like:
