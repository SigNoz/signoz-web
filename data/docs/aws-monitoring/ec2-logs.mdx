title: Send Application/Server Logs from EC2 to SigNoz
---

## Introduction

This documentation provides detailed instructions on how to send application and server logs from an EC2 instance to **SigNoz**. By integrating with SigNoz, you can 
efficiently collect, monitor, and analyze your logs for better insights into your applications and servers.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux-based EC2 instance

### Install OpenTelemetry Collector

You can install OpenTelemetry collector as an agent on your Virtual Machine by following this [guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/).
The OpenTelemetry collector provides a vendor-neutral way to collect, process, and export telemetry data such as logs, metrics, and traces.

### Dummy Log File

As an example, use a sample log file called `app.log` with the following dummy data:

```
This is log line 1
This is log line 2
This is log line 3
This is log line 4
This is log line 5
```

This file represents a log file of your application/server.

### Configure Filelog Receiver

Receivers are used to get data into the collector. A filelog receiver collects logs from files. Modify the `config.yaml` file that you created while installing 
the OTel collector to include the filelog receiver. Specify the path to your `app.log` file (or your actual log file) and set the `start_at` parameter.

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  filelog/app:
    include: [ /tmp/app.log ] # include the full path to your log file
    start_at: end
```

<Admonition>
The `start_at: end` configuration ensures that only newly added logs are transmitted. If you wish to include historical logs from the file, set `start_at` to 
`beginning`.
</Admonition>

### Update Pipeline Configuration

Receivers must be enabled via pipelines within the `service` section of the collector config file. Update the pipeline configuration in `config.yaml`:

```yaml:config.yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, filelog/app]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Restart the OpenTelemetry Collector by following the steps outlined in [this guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/).

### Verifying the Exported Logs

The logs will be exported to the SigNoz Cloud UI. If you add more entries to your `app.log` file, they will also appear in the SigNoz Logs Explorer.
