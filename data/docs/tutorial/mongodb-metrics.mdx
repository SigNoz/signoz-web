description: View MongoDB metrics in SigNoz
---

This tutorial shows you how you can visualise MongoDB metrics in SigNoz. We take an example of a FastAPI sample app which uses MongoDB to walk through this tutorial. 

Based on how you are using MongoDB, your exact steps may be different - but this should give you an idea of how to go about it.

### Install FastAPI sample app via docker

1. Clone this sample [FastAPI application](https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-fastapi-with-dbs#run-using-docker-compose)

  Follow instructions in the README file to set up the application. Please ensure to point the FastAPI application to IP of the machine where SigNoz is installed

2. Use `172.17.0.1` - if running SigNoz also in same VM as the FastAPI application

  ```bash
  http://172.17.0.1:4317
  ```

This comes with Mongo Exporter built in which exposes metrics in prometheus format at port 9216

### Check that MongoDB metrics are exposed at following end point

```bash
curl http://localhost:9216/metrics
```

### Update Otel Collector config file to scrape MongoDb metrics

Add a job name corresponding to mongodb exporter in otel-collector config file in your SigNoz install

Make changes in otel-collector file. If you've [self-hosted SigNoz](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/), you can find the otel-collector file [here](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/develop/deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/otel-collector-config.yaml).

```bash
- job_name: "mongo-collector"
  scrape_interval: 30s
  static_configs:
  - targets: ["172.17.0.1:9216"]
```

Job names should be aligned.Please ensure that the edited YAML is correctly configured. You can use tools like [http://www.yamllint.com/](http://www.yamllint.com/) to check the correctness of the updated YAML file.

If you're using the SigNoz Cloud, make sure to run the collector service again with the following command:

```
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

You can read more about how to deploy the OpenTelemetry binary as an agent [here](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/).
### Restart Otel Collector container

```bash
docker compose --env-file ./docker/clickhouse-setup/env/x86_64.env -f docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml restart otel-collector
```

For self host, you can try running the install script once again to make sure otel collector container is able to collect the telemetry data from the application.

Check that otel-collector is running by doing

```docker
sudo docker ps
```

## Plotting Mongo metrics in SigNoz

There are a lot of metrics that you can actually plot on the SigNoz Dashboard. If you'd like to monitor
some specific metrics, this is a [good guide on metrics you may want to monitor](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/how-to-monitor-mongodb-and-what-metrics-to-monitor)

Create new panels in [Dashboard section](/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards-and-panels) of SigNoz and add the following queries for example. 

```bash
PromQL query - mongodb_ss_connections
Legend Format - {{conn_type}}

PromQL query - rate(mongodb_ss_opcounters[5m])
Legend Format - {{legacy_op_type}}
```
This is a [good guide](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/) to help you understand on how to create your own dashboard at SigNoz.

You can use queries from the json files here to plot more metrics
