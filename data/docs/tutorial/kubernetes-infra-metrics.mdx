### Overview

To export Kubernetes metrics, you can enable different receivers in OpenTelemetry
collector which will send metrics about your Kubernetes infrastructure
to SigNoz. These OpenTelemetry collectors will act as agents which send
metrics about Kubernetes to SigNoz.

OtelCollector agent can also be used to tail and parse logs generated by
container using `filelog` receiver and send it to desired receiver.

`K8s-Infra` helm chart mainly does the following:
- Tails and parses logs generated by containers in Kubernetes cluster and sends to SigNoz
- Collects kubelet metrics and host metrics from each nodes of the Kubernetes cluster
- Collects cluster-level metrics from the Kubernetes API server
- Acts as a gateway to send any incoming OTLP telemetry data to SigNoz OtelCollector

---

Based on how you are running SigNoz (e.g. SigNoz Cloud, in an independent VM or Kubernetes cluster),
you have to provide the address to send data from the above receivers.

### Install K8s-Infra chart

To add the SigNoz Helm repository to your helm client, run the following command:

```bash
helm repo add signoz https://charts.signoz.io
```

If the chart is already present, update the chart to the latest version:

```bash
helm repo update
```

To install the `k8s-infra` chart, run the following command:

```bash
helm install my-release signoz/k8s-infra  \
  --set otelCollectorEndpoint=ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443 \
  --set otelInsecure=false \
  --set signozApiKey=<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY> \
  --set global.clusterName=<CLUSTER_NAME>
```

Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the ingestion endpoint will vary according to this table.

| Region	| Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| US | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |
  
<Admonition>
- Replace `SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY` with the one provided by SigNoz.
- Replace `<CLUSTER_NAME>` with the name of the Kubernetes cluster or a unique identifier of the
  cluster.

## Send data from applications to OtelCollectors in your infra

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>

    <figcaption><i>OpenTelemetry instrumented application sends data to OTelAgent Daemon deployed in your k8s infra. The OTelAgent daemon sends the collected data to SigNoz Cloud.</i></figcaption>
</figure>


To send data from your applications, you must first instrument it with OpenTelemetry. You can find instrumentation instructions for your specific language [here](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/). 


Once you're done instrumenting your application, add below to your application manifest files for applications to start sending data to the otel-collectors running as daemonset. Eg. add the below config to the `deployment.yaml` of your application.

```YAML
env:
  - name: HOST_IP
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: status.hostIP
  - name: K8S_POD_IP
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        apiVersion: v1
        fieldPath: status.podIP
  - name: K8S_POD_UID
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: metadata.uid
  - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE
    value: "true"
  - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
    value: $(HOST_IP):4317
  - name: OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES
    value: service.name=APPLICATION_NAME,k8s.pod.ip=$(K8S_POD_IP),k8s.pod.uid=$(K8S_POD_UID)
  ```
  
<Admonition>
  - Replace `APPLICATION_NAME` with your application name that you wish to see in SigNoz.
  - In cases of some SDKs, you would have to include `https://` prefix for `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`

<Admonition type="info">
By default, SigNoz Helm chart installs `k8s-infra` dependency chart which
handles the task of collecting metrics and logs from the Kubernetes cluster.

If you have single Kubernetes cluster for SigNoz and your applications,
you need not install `k8s-infra` chart.
</Admonition>



### Install K8s-Infra chart

To add the SigNoz Helm repository to your helm client, run the following command:

```bash
helm repo add signoz https://charts.signoz.io
```

If the chart is already present, update the chart to the latest version:

```bash
helm repo update
```

To install the `k8s-infra` chart, run the following command:

```bash
helm install my-release signoz/k8s-infra  \
--set otelCollectorEndpoint=<IP-or-Endpoint-of-SigNoz-OtelCollector>:4317
```

<Admonition type="info">
If the OtelCollector endpoint is secured, you would have to enable `otelInsecure`
configuration and often make other changes such as including either config
or path to the TLS certificate and private key.

### Disable Logs Collection

In case you do not want to collect logs from your Kubernetes cluster, you
can disable using presets in `k8s-infra` chart.

```yaml
presets:
  logsCollection:
    enabled: false
```

### Disable Metrics Collection

In case you do not want to collect metrics from your Kubernetes cluster, you
can disable using presets in `k8s-infra` chart.

```yaml
presets:
  hostMetrics:
    enabled: false
  kubeletMetrics:
    enabled: false
  clusterMetrics:
    enabled: false

otelDeployment:
  enabled: false
```

## Plot Metrics in SigNoz UI

To plot metrics generated from `k8s-infra` chart, follow the instructions given in the docs [here][4].

Check out the [List of metrics from Kubernetes receiver][3].

Here are some examples of metrics dashboard.

1. **Import Dashboard with PVC Metrics**

   You can import dashboard with PVC metrics of Kubernetes cluster
   from [here][5].

2. **Import Dashboard with Overall Kubernetes pods Metrics**

   You can import dashboard with the general Kubernetes pods metrics of your K8s cluster from [here][6].

3. **Import Dashboard with Detailed Kubernetes pods Metrics**

   You can import dashboard with more detailed granular Kubernetes pods metrics of your K8s cluster from [here][7].

4. **Import Dashboard with Overall Kubernetes Node Metrics**

   You can import dashboard with the general Kubernetes node metrics of your K8s cluster from [here][8].

5. **Import Dashboard with Detailed Kubernetes Node Metrics**

   You can import dashboard with more detailed granular Kubernetes node metrics of your K8s cluster from [here][9].

In the Dashboard page of SigNoz UI, you can create your own widgets as per you
need using metrics from the [list below][3].
