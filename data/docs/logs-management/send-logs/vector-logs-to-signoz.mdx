This guide explains how to forward logs from [Vector](https://vector.dev/) to SigNoz.

## Configure Vector 

We will configure vector to send logs to **SigNoz Cloud**

### Prerequisites

- Vector running on your system

### Setup

Follow these steps to set up Vector for forwarding logs to SigNoz Cloud:

1. Open your Vector configuration file (usually `config.yaml`)
2. Add the following sink configuration to the file:
    ```yaml
    signoz_sink:
      type: http
      inputs:
        - <SOURCE_NAME>
      uri: https://ingest.<REGION>.signoz.cloud/logs/vector
      encoding:
        codec: json
      request:
        headers:
          signoz-ingestion-key: "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
    ```

`<SOURCE_NAME>`: The name of your [Vector source](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sources/) (e.g., docker)

`<REGION>`: Region of your SigNoz Cloud tenant

`<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>`: SigNoz Cloud ingestion key

Save the configuration file and restart Vector to apply the changes.


## Log Mapping for SigNoz

SigNoz processes incoming logs from Vector as follows:

- The `timestamp` field is automatically parsed.
- The `source_type` is moved to resource attributes.
- The `message` key is mapped to the `body` field.

### OpenTelemetry (OTEL) Schema Transformation

You can consider transforming your logs to the OpenTelemetry schema at the Vector level. The OTEL schema structure is as follows:
```
{
  "trace_id": "<hex string>",
  "span_id": "<hex string>",
  "trace_flags": "<int>",
  "severity_text": "<string>",
  "severity_number": "<int>",
  "attributes": "<map>",
  "resources": "<map>",
  "source_type": "<string>",
  "message": "<string>"
}
```

Example of a transformed log entry:
```
{
  "trace_id": "000000000000000018c51935df0b93b9",
  "span_id": "18c51935df0b93b9",
  "trace_flags": 0,
  "severity_text": "info",
  "severity_number": 4,
  "attributes": {
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/api/users"
  },
  "resources": {
      "host": "myhost",
      "namespace": "prod"
  },
  "source_type": "docker",
  "message": "This is a log line"
}
```

**Note:** Any fields not included in the OTEL schema will be automatically moved to log attributes by SigNoz.


If you prefer not to transform logs at Vector level, you can use SigNoz [pipelines](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/introduction/) for processing the logs.
