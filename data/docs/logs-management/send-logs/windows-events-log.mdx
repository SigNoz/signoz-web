title: Windows Events log to SigNoz

## Overview

If you are using a Windows environment, you can stream Windows Event Log to SigNoz using OpenTelemetry Collector.

Monitoring specific Event Log sources, known as Channels, can be done using the Windows Event Log receiver which is configured in the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file. 

Key channels typically monitored include:

- **Application:** Logs events related to applications running on the system.
- **Security:** Records security-related events such as login attempts and resource access.
- **System:** Captures events related to system components, drivers, and services.

## Prerequisites

- SigNoz [cloud account](https://signoz.io/teams/)
- Microsoft User account with permissions to access EventLog and Services


## Setup

### Step 1: Install OpenTelemetry Collector
The OpenTelemetry collector provides a vendor-neutral way to collect, process, and export your telemetry data such as logs, metrics, and traces.

You can install OpenTelemetry collector as an agent on your Virtual Machine by following this [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/).


### Step 2: Add windowseventlog receiver 


#### Configure windowseventlog receiver 

Modify the `config.yaml` file created in the previous step to include the `windowseventlog` receiver in the receiver section. The below codeblock shows how you can 
add the receiver to get the windows application and system logs.

```yaml
receivers:
    windowseventlog/application:
        channel: application
    windowseventlog/system:
        channel: system
```

There are more configuration options available [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/windowseventlogreceiver/README.md)

#### Update pipelines configuration

In the same `config.yaml` file, update the pipelines section to include the `windowseventlog/application` and `windowseventlog/system` receivers under `logs`.

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
  ....
    logs:
      receivers: [windowseventlog/application, windowseventlog/system]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```
If there are no errors, your Event logs will be visible in SigNoz under the Logs Tab.

This is what the typical output will look like with the configurations we made above:
