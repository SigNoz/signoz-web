## Overview

This documentation provides detailed instructions on configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector to read logs from SystemD's journal (JournalD) and push them to SigNoz. SystemD logs are structured and contain rich metadata that can help you monitor system services, troubleshoot issues, and track service performance.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that:
- Linux-based operating system
- `journalctl` binary is available in the `$PATH`

## Sample SystemD Logs

SystemD generates structured logs for all services managed by it. Here's what typical journal entries look like:

```plaintext
Jun 25 10:30:45 hostname systemd[1]: Started myapp.service.
Jun 25 10:30:46 hostname myapp[1234]: Application started successfully
Jun 25 10:30:47 hostname myapp[1234]: Processing user request
```

These logs contain rich metadata including timestamps, hostnames, process IDs, service names, and priority levels.

You can check the SystemD logs using the following command:

```bash
sudo journalctl -n 10
```
## Setup

<Tabs entityName="plans">

<TabItem value="signoz-cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

### Step 1: Install OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib

The [JournalD receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/journaldreceiver/README.md) is available in the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib distribution.

Follow this [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) to install the OpenTelemetry Collector.

### Step 2: Configure JournalD Receiver

Modify the `config.yaml` file created during the installation of the OpenTelemetry Collector to include the `journald` receiver:

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  journald:
    directory: /var/log/journal
    start_at: end

  # Keep your existing receivers
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
processors:
  batch: {}
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<your-ingestion-key>"
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, journald]        #Add the journald receiver to pipelines
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

<Admonition type="info">
You can also include the below configuration options for JournalD receiver:

**Configuration Options:**
- `start_at: end` - Only collect new logs after the collector starts
- `start_at: beginning` - Include historical logs from the journal
- `units` - Filter logs from specific SystemD services
- `priority` - Filter by log level (debug, info, notice, warning, err, crit, alert, emerg)
- `matches` - Advanced filtering using journalctl match syntax

More options available [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/journaldreceiver/README.md)
</Admonition>

### Step 3: Start the OTel Collector

Start the OpenTelemetry Collector using the above `config.yaml` file:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

### Step 1: Install SigNoz

Follow this [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/install/docker/) to install self-hosted SigNoz.

### Step 2: Configure JournalD Receiver

Update `otel-collector-config.yaml` with the following configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  journald:
    directory: /var/log/journal
    start_at: end
    priority: info

  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 10000
    timeout: 10s

exporters:
  clickhouselogsexporter:
    dsn: tcp://clickhouse:9000/signoz_logs
    timeout: 5s
    sending_queue:
      queue_size: 100
    retry_on_failure:
      enabled: true
      initial_interval: 5s
      max_interval: 30s
      max_elapsed_time: 300s

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, journald]           #Add the journald receiver to pipelines
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [clickhouselogsexporter]
```

<Admonition type="warning">
Note: Running the collector as root (`user: "0:0"`) is required to access journal files. In production, consider creating a dedicated user with journal access permissions.

You can also include the below configuration options for JournalD receiver:

**Configuration Options:**
- `start_at: end` - Only collect new logs after the collector starts
- `start_at: beginning` - Include historical logs from the journal
- `units` - Filter logs from specific SystemD services
- `priority` - Filter by log level (debug, info, notice, warning, err, crit, alert, emerg)
- `matches` - Advanced filtering using journalctl match syntax

More options available [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/journaldreceiver/README.md)
</Admonition>

### Step 3: Restart OTel Collector

Restart the collector for the changes to take effect:
```bash
docker-compose restart otel-collector
```

You should now be able to see the SystemD logs on SigNoz.

## Visualizing Logs in SigNoz

The SystemD logs will be visible in the `Logs` tab of SigNoz.

### Understanding SystemD Log Fields

SystemD logs include rich metadata. Common fields include:

- `MESSAGE` - The actual log message
- `_SYSTEMD_UNIT` - SystemD unit that generated the log
- `PRIORITY` - Log priority (0-7, where 0 is emergency, 7 is debug)
- `_PID` - Process ID
- `_HOSTNAME` - System hostname
- `_TIMESTAMP` - Timestamp when the log was generated
- `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER` - Program name
- `_COMM` - Command name

## Advanced Configuration

### Filtering Logs

You can filter SystemD logs in several ways:

#### By SystemD Units
```yaml
receivers:
  journald:
    directory: /var/log/journal
    units:
      - "nginx.service"
      - "postgresql.service"
      - "myapp.service"
```

#### By Priority Level
```yaml
receivers:
  journald:
    directory: /var/log/journal
    priority: warning  # Only warning, err, crit, alert, emerg
```

#### By Custom Matches
```yaml
receivers:
  journald:
    directory: /var/log/journal
    matches:
      - "_TRANSPORT=kernel"
      - "PRIORITY=6"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

If you see permission errors:
```bash
# Check journal access
sudo journalctl --verify
```

### Log Generation

Check if SystemD is generating logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -n 10
```
