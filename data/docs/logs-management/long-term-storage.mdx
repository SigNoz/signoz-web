import GetHelp from '@/components/shared/get-help.md'

## Overview

SigNoz provides two ways for long term log storage for SigNoz Cloud customers.

1. Forwarding to your own S3/Google Cloud Storage
2. Long term storage with object storage also in SigNoz Cloud

### Forwarding to your own S3/Google Cloud Storage

**(This option is deprecated as of August 2024)**

You can configure forwarding logs from SigNoz to S3/Google Cloud Storage in your own infra. The data is stored in ClickHouse native format and you would need an instance of SigNoz to query this data.

The pricing for this plan is as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Log forwarding cost</td>
    <td>$0.25/GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rehydration cost</td>
    <td>$1.2/mn log lines</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Notes

- Logs data is stored in ClickHouse Native format in the object storage
- Even if you stop subscribing SigNoz Cloud, you can query it using SigNoz open source version

### Long term storage with object storage also in SigNoz Cloud

In this option, customers don't need to send data to a separate object storage instance. They can configure in SigNoz how many days they want to keep their data in Hot storage (faster query response) and how many days do they want to keep their data in Cold storage (slower query response). This option allows users to manage their costs even when storing logs data for long period of times for compliance and other needs.

The pricing for this plan is as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Hot Storage Period</th>
    <th colspan="5">Period in Cold Storage after Hot Storage</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>0 day</th>
    <th>90 days</th>
    <th>180 days</th>
    <th>1 yr</th>
    <th>2 yrs</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>15 days (in $/GB)</td>
    <td>0.3</td>
    <td>0.45</td>
    <td>0.6</td>
    <td>0.9</td>
    <td>1.3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>30 days (in $/GB)</td>
    <td>0.4</td>
    <td>0.55</td>
    <td>0.7</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1.4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>90 days (in $/GB)</td>
    <td>0.6</td>
    <td>0.75</td>
    <td>0.9</td>
    <td>1.2</td>
    <td>1.6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>180 days (in $/GB)</td>
    <td>0.8</td>
    <td>0.95</td>
    <td>1.1</td>
    <td>1.4</td>
    <td>1.8</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### How does querying in Hot storage compare to querying in Cold storage?

For a typical query, cold storage is typically 3 times slower. The exact performance difference depends a lot on the exact query.
