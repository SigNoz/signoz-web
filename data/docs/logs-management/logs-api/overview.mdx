## Overview

The SigNoz Logs API is a robust interface which enables developers to manage and analyze log data efficiently. This API facilitates various operations:

- **Searching Logs:** Allows users to search through log data based on specific criteria. For example, finding all logs where the error code is 500.

- **Paginating Logs:** Helps in navigating through large sets of log data in a manageable way. For instance, retrieving logs in batches of 100 for easy viewing.

- **Aggregating Logs:** Enables summarizing log data to extract meaningful insights, such as aggregating logs to count the number of errors per day.


## API Endpoint

Endpoint for Logs API:

`POST` `https://{URL}/api/v3/query_range`

Replace `{URL}` with your instance URL, e.g., example.signoz.io.

## Prerequisites

Access Token: To access this API, you need an Access Token. Navigate to the `Settings` page in the SigNoz UI and create a new Access Token.

Access Tokens can only be created/managed by users with the `Admin` role. If you don't have the `Admin` role, contact your organization's admin to create an Access Token for you.

## Authentication

Using the Access Token: Add the Access token to your request header as follows: 

```bash
SIGNOZ-API-KEY:{YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}
```

Secure storage and handling of your Access Token is crucial to prevent unauthorized access.
