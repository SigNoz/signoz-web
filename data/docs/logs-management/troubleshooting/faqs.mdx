### Q. I can't see related logs for traces.  
A. Make sure your logs include `trace_id` and `span_id`.

<details>
<summary>Show detailed steps</summary>

* If you are collecting application logs from file, ensure you emit the `trace_id` and `span_id` to those logs.
* Once you have `trace_id` and `span_id` in your logs, parse them using the pipelines trace parser. See documentation [here](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/guides/trace/).

</details>

### Q. I want to extract trace_id and span_id from my log line  
A. You can extract these using the logs pipelines trace parser. See documentation [here](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/guides/trace/).

### Q. I want to extract an attribute from my log line  
A. Use Logs Pipeline to parse and extract attributes.

<details>

The best way to do this is using Logs Pipeline. Refer to:  
- [Logs Pipeline Introduction](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/introduction/)  
- [Parse JSON logs with Pipelines](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/guides/json/)

### Q. How to filter logs of same application/service from different hosts?
A. You can identify them by adding a resource attribute.

<details>
<summary>Show detailed steps</summary>

If you have a application/service which is emitting similar kind of logs but there are multiple instances of it running on different
hosts you can identify them by adding a resource attribute.

There are different ways to add a resource attribute.

1. By passing it as an environment variable if you are using the opentelemetry SDK or auto-instrumentation
    ```
    OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name>,host.name=<host_name>
    ```
    Replace the value of `<service_name>` with the actual service name and `<host_name>` with the actual hostname
2. If you have a otel collector running on each host you can add a processor to add the hostname.
    ```yaml
    processors:
        resource/add_hostname:
            attributes:
                - key: host.name
                  value: <host_name>
                  action: upsert
    ...
    service:
        logs:
            processors: [resource/add_hostname, batch]
    ```
    replace the value of `<host_name>` with the actual hostname

### Q. I am sending logs but my logs are not visible on SigNoz  
A. Check your exporter and collector configuration.

<details>
<summary>Show detailed troubleshooting steps</summary>

- Add a console exporter at the application level (if using SDK) or at the local collector level.
- If the issue persists, reach out to us via chatbox at the bottom right corner of your SigNoz Cloud interface.

### Q. How to increase the retention period of logs from x days to y days?  
A. If you are using SigNoz Cloud, contact SigNoz support via the chatbox. Or if you are self-hosting, you can change the retention period in the SigNoz UI under Settings > Logs Retention.

### Q. In java my mdc attributes are not visible in SigNoz  
A. Ensure your logging configuration includes MDC pattern and OpenTelemetry is configured to capture MDC attributes.

<details>
<summary>Show detailed configuration steps</summary>

You can get your mdc attributes by using the [appender settings][def] and passing it as `-D<property>=<value>` format.

For example, for **logback** use:  
`otel.instrumentation.logback-appender.experimental.capture-mdc-attributes=*`  
For **log4j** use:  
`otel.instrumentation.log4j-appender.experimental.capture-mdc-attributes=*`  
See [this documentation][def] for more system properties.
