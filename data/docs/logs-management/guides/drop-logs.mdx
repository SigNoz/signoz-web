## Overview

The filter processor in OpenTelemetry allows you to drop logs based on body, log level (aka severity text), or other attributes. This is useful if you want to exclude certain logs from being sent to SigNoz.

The filter processor is configured in the `processors::filter` section of the `otel-collector-config.yaml` file.

<Admonition>

The processor needs to be added to the logs pipeline to take effect. 
```
logs:
  receivers: [otlp]
  processors: [filter/drop_logs_by_severity_text, batch]
  exporters: [otlp]
```

## Drop Logs 
1. Drop logs by log level / severity text

```yaml
processors:
  filter/drop_logs_by_level:
    logs:
      log_record:
        - 'IsMatch(severity_text, "(?i)\b(DEBUG)\b")'
```

2. Drop logs by body regex

```yaml
processors:
  filter/drop_logs_by_body_regex:
    logs:
      log_record:
        - 'IsMatch(body, ".*password.*")'
```


3. Drop logs by resource attributes (like service.name, host.name, k8s.pod.name, etc.)

```yaml
processors:
  filter/drop_logs_by_label_values:
    logs:
      log_record:
        - resource.attributes["k8s.pod.name"] == "test-pod"
```

4. Drop logs by resource attributes regex

```yaml
processors:
  filter/drop_logs_by_label_values_regex:
    logs:
      log_record:
        - IsMatch(resource.attributes["k8s.pod.name"], "test-pod-.*")
```

5. Drop logs by logs attributes (like remote_addr, user_agent.name, etc.)

```yaml
processors:
  filter/drop_logs_by_label_values:
    logs:
      log_record:
        - attributes["user_agent.name"] == "Safari"
```

6. Drop logs by logs attributes regex

```yaml
processors:
  filter/drop_logs_by_label_values_regex:
    logs:
      log_record:
        - IsMatch(attributes["http.method"], "GET|POST")
```

Refer to the [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/filterprocessor) for more details on how to configure the filter processor.
