title: Monitoring LangChain Telemetry with SigNoz
description: Enable telemetry in your LangChain application with OpenTelemetry and send traces, logs, and metrics to SigNoz
---

## Overview

This guide walks you through instrumenting your Python-based [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) application and streaming telemetry data to SigNoz Cloud using OpenTelemetry. By the end of this setup, you'll be able to monitor AI-specific operations such as agent reasoning steps, tool invocations, API calls, and intermediate chain executions within LangChain, with detailed spans capturing request durations, tool inputs and outputs, model responses, and metadata throughout the agentâ€™s decision-making process.

Instrumenting your agent workflows with telemetry enables full observability across the reasoning and action pipeline. This is especially valuable when building production-grade AI applications, where insight into agent behavior, latency bottlenecks, tool call performance, and response accuracy is essential. With SigNoz, you can trace each user request end-to-endâ€”from the initial prompt through every intermediate reasoning step, tool execution, and final answerâ€”and continuously improve performance, reliability, and user experience.

To get started, check out our example LangChain agent with OpenTelemetry-based monitoring (via OpenInference). View the full repository [here](insert link to repo).

## Prerequisites

- A Python application using **Python 3.8+**
- LangChain integrated into your app
- Basic understanding of AI Agents and tool calling workflow
- A [SigNoz Cloud account](https://signoz.io/teams/) with an active ingestion key
- `pip` installed for managing Python packages
- Internet access to send telemetry data to SigNoz Cloud
- *(Optional but recommended)* A Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies

## Instrument your LangChain application

To capture detailed telemetry from LlamaIndex without modifying your core application logic, we use [OpenInference](https://arize.com/docs/ax/learn/tracing-concepts/what-is-openinference), a community-driven standard that provides pre-built instrumentation for popular AI frameworks like LangChain, built on top of OpenTelemetry. This allows you to trace your LangChain application with minimal configuration.

Check out detailed instructions on how to set up OpenInference instrumentation in your LlamaIndex application over [here](https://pypi.org/project/openinference-instrumentation-langchain/).

**Step 1:** Install OpenInference and OpenTelemetry related packages

```bash
pip install openinference-instrumentation-langchain \
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp \
opentelemetry-sdk
```

**Step 3:** Import the necessary modules in your Python application

```python
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
from openinference.instrumentation.langchain import LangChainInstrumentor
```

**Step 4:** Set up the OpenTelemetry Tracer Provider to send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud

```python
resource = Resource.create({"service.name": "<service_name>"})
provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
span_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(
    endpoint="https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443/v1/traces",
    headers={"signoz-ingestion-key": "<your-ingestion-key>"},
)
provider.add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(span_exporter))
```

- **`<service_name>`**Â is the name of your service
- Set theÂ **`<region>`**Â to match your SigNoz CloudÂ [**region**](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- ReplaceÂ **`<your-ingestion-key>`**Â with your SigNozÂ [**ingestion key**](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

**Step 5:** Instrument LangChain using OpenInference

Use the `LangChainInstrumentor` from OpenInference to automatically trace LangChain operations with your OpenTelemetry setup:

```python
LangChainInstrumentor().instrument()
```

> ðŸ“Œ Important:  Place this code at the start of your application logic â€” before any LangChain functions are called or used â€” to ensure telemetry is correctly captured.
> 

Your LangChain commands should now automatically emit traces, spans, and attributes.

Finally, you should be able to view this data in Signoz Cloud under the traces tab:

When you click on a trace ID in SigNoz, you'll see a detailed view of the trace, including all associated spans, along with their events and attributes:
