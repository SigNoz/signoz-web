title: OpenTelemetry Collector for Docker Swarm - Install
id: install
description: Step-by-step guide to install OpenTelemetry Collector on Docker Swarm
---

## Prerequisites

Before installing the OpenTelemetry Collector, ensure you have:

- Docker Engine 20.10+ installed and running
- Docker Swarm initialized (run `docker swarm init` if not already)
- Administrative access to the Docker host/cluster

## Installation

### Step 1: Create Configuration Directory

Creates a dedicated directory to organize the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/opentelemetry-collector
cd ~/opentelemetry-collector
```

### Step 2: Create Collector Configuration

Defines how the OpenTelemetry Collector receives, processes, and exports telemetry data to SigNoz.

Create `config.yaml`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.<YOUR_REGION>.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<YOUR_INGESTION_KEY>"
  debug:
    verbosity: normal

extensions:
  health_check:
  pprof:
  zpages:

service:
  extensions: [health_check, pprof, zpages]
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

**Configuration Steps:**
- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="self-hosted" label="Self-Hosted SigNoz">

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "http://<SIGNOZ_HOST>:4317"
    tls:
      insecure: true
  debug:
    verbosity: normal

extensions:
  health_check:
  pprof:
  zpages:

service:
  extensions: [health_check, pprof, zpages]
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

**Configuration Steps:**
- Replace `<SIGNOZ_HOST>` with your SigNoz instance hostname or IP address

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Create a Docker Swarm Config

Adds the collector configuration to Swarm as a config object.

```bash
docker config create otelcol_config ./config.yaml
```

If you need to update it later, create a new config (for example `otelcol_config_v2`) and update the service to use the new one.

### Step 4: Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector Service

Starts the OpenTelemetry Collector as a Swarm service to receive and forward telemetry data to SigNoz.

```bash
docker service create \
  --name opentelemetry-collector \
  --detach=true \
  --restart-condition any \
  --publish target=4317,published=4317,protocol=tcp \
  --publish target=4318,published=4318,protocol=tcp \
  --config source=otelcol_config,target=/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml,mode=0444 \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.130.1
```

Optional: attach to an existing overlay network if your apps send data over that network:

```bash
docker service create \
  --name opentelemetry-collector \
  --network your_overlay_network \
  --publish target=4317,published=4317,protocol=tcp \
  --publish target=4318,published=4318,protocol=tcp \
  --config source=otelcol_config,target=/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml,mode=0444 \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.130.1
```

Tip: To collect container and service metrics, follow Configure and add the `docker_stats` receiver.

## Verification

### Check Collector Status

Verify that the OpenTelemetry Collector service is running and healthy.

List the service
```bash
docker service ls | grep opentelemetry-collector
```

Inspect tasks (replicas and placement)
```bash
docker service ps opentelemetry-collector
```

Check collector logs (from a task/container)
```bash
docker service logs -f opentelemetry-collector
```

You should see logs indicating successful startup and readiness to process data.

## Send Docker data

Once you have your collector up and running, you can see your container logs, metrics and application traces by following the below links:
- [Send Docker logs](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/collect_docker_logs/)
- [Send Containers metrics](https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/docker-container-metrics/)
- [Send Application traces](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/)

## Troubleshooting

### Service Already Exists

If you get an error about the service already existing:

```bash
# Check existing services
docker service ls | grep opentelemetry-collector

# Remove the existing service
docker service rm opentelemetry-collector

# Then re-create the service
```

### Configuration Errors

If the collector fails to start, check the service logs and task status:

```bash
docker service logs -f opentelemetry-collector
docker service ps opentelemetry-collector --no-trunc
```

Common issues:
- Invalid YAML syntax in config file
- Missing or incorrect SigNoz credentials
- Port conflicts with other services on published ports
- Config not found or unreadable (ensure the config name matches and path is `/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml`)

The OpenTelemetry Collector service is now running and ready to receive telemetry data on ports 4317 (gRPC) and 4318 (HTTP) across your Swarm cluster.
