description: Step-by-step guide to install OpenTelemetry Collector for Docker environments
---

## Prerequisites

Before installing the OpenTelemetry Collector, ensure you have:

- Docker Engine 20.10+ installed and running
- Administrative access to the Docker host

## Installation

### Step 1: Create Configuration Directory

Creates a dedicated directory to organize the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/opentelemetry-collector
cd ~/opentelemetry-collector
```

### Step 2: Create Collector Configuration

Defines how the OpenTelemetry Collector receives, processes, and exports telemetry data to SigNoz.

Create `config.yaml`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.<YOUR_REGION>.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<YOUR_INGESTION_KEY>"
  debug:
    verbosity: normal

extensions:
  health_check:
  pprof:
  zpages:

service:
  extensions: [health_check, pprof, zpages]
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

**Configuration Steps:**
- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="self-hosted" label="Self-Hosted SigNoz">

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "http://<SIGNOZ_HOST>:4317"
    tls:
      insecure: true
  debug:
    verbosity: normal

extensions:
  health_check:
  pprof:
  zpages:

service:
  extensions: [health_check, pprof, zpages]
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

**Configuration Steps:**
- Replace `<SIGNOZ_HOST>` with your SigNoz instance hostname or IP address

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Run the OpenTelemetry Collector

Starts the OpenTelemetry Collector as a Docker container to begin receiving and forwarding telemetry data to SigNoz.

```bash
docker run --name opentelemetry-collector \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --detach \
  -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml":/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.130.1
```

## Verification

### Check Collector Status

Verifies that the OpenTelemetry Collector container is running and operational.

Check if container is running
```bash
docker ps | grep opentelemetry-collector
```

Check collector logs
```bash
docker logs opentelemetry-collector
```

You will see the OpenTelemetry Collector logs indicating successful startup and readiness to process data.

## Send Docker data

Once you have your collector up and running, you can see your container logs, metrics and application traces by following the below links:
- [Send Docker logs](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/collect_docker_logs/)
- [Send Containers metrics](https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/docker-container-metrics/)
- [Send Application traces](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/)

## Troubleshooting

### Container Name Already in Use

If you get an error about the container name already being in use:

```bash
# Check existing containers
docker ps -a | grep opentelemetry-collector

# Stop and remove the existing container
docker stop opentelemetry-collector
docker rm opentelemetry-collector

# Then re-run the installation command
```

### Configuration Errors

If the collector fails to start, check the logs:

```bash
docker logs opentelemetry-collector
```

Common issues:
- Invalid YAML syntax in config file
- Missing or incorrect SigNoz credentials
- Port conflicts with other services

The OpenTelemetry Collector is now running and ready to receive telemetry data on ports 4317 (gRPC) and 4318 (HTTP).
