## What is ECS Daemon Service Collection?

This documentation explains how to collect metrics and logs from your Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) infrastructure using a daemon service approach. The daemon service runs a container on each node of your ECS cluster to collect infrastructure metrics and logs, then forwards them to SigNoz for monitoring and analysis.

## How It Works

The daemon service approach involves deploying a specialized container that:

1. **Runs as a daemon**: The service deploys one container per ECS cluster node
2. **Collects infrastructure data**: Gathers metrics and logs from the host instance and Docker containers
3. **Acts as a gateway**: Receives OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) telemetry data from your applications
4. **Forwards to SigNoz**: Sends all collected data to your SigNoz instance for visualization and analysis

## Architecture Overview

```
ECS Cluster Nodes
├── Your Application Containers
├── Daemon Service Container (OpenTelemetry Collector)
│   ├── Collects host metrics
│   ├── Collects container logs  
│   ├── Receives OTLP data from apps
│   └── Forwards data to SigNoz
```

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the daemon service, ensure you have:

- **ECS Cluster**: An active ECS cluster with at least one task definition
- **Launch Type**: Your ECS cluster must use either **EC2** or **External** launch type
- **SigNoz Instance**: Either SigNoz Cloud account or self-hosted SigNoz installation
- **AWS CLI**: Configured with appropriate permissions for ECS and CloudFormation operations
- **IAM Permissions**: Access to create CloudFormation stacks, ECS services, and Parameter Store resources

> **Note for Fargate Users**: If you're using Fargate launch type, this daemon service approach won't work. Instead, check out the [ECS Sidecar documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/collection-agents/ecs/sidecar/overview) for Fargate-compatible collection methods.

## What Data Gets Collected?

The daemon service collects several types of data:

### Infrastructure Metrics
- CPU utilization and memory usage
- Network I/O statistics  
- Disk usage and I/O metrics
- Container-level resource consumption

### Container Logs
- Application logs from running containers
- System logs from the ECS instances
- Docker daemon logs

### Application Telemetry (Optional)
- Traces from instrumented applications
- Custom metrics from your services
- Any OTLP-compatible telemetry data


### EC2 Launch Type
- Full support for daemon service deployment
- Direct access to host metrics and logs
- Container runs with host network access
- Can collect comprehensive infrastructure data

### External Launch Type
- Supported for external compute resources
- Similar functionality to EC2 launch type
- May require additional network configuration
- Good for hybrid cloud setups
