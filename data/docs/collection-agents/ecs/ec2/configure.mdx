title: ECS EC2 Collection Agent - Configure
description: View metrics and logs for your ECS infrastructure
---

This guide covers configuring your daemon service after installation, verifying data flow, and setting up application data collection.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring, ensure you have:
- Completed the [installation steps](/docs/collection-agents/ecs/ec2/install.md)
- Daemon service running on your ECS cluster
- Access to SigNoz Cloud or self-hosted instance

## Verify Data Collection

Log into your SigNoz instance and check that ECS infrastructure metrics and logs are being received.

To visualize ECS data, import pre-built dashboards:

- [instance-metrics.json](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/ecs-infra-metrics/instance-metrics.json)
- [hostmetrics.json](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/hostmetrics/hostmetrics.json)

Import these in the **Dashboards** section of SigNoz.

## Send Data from Applications

<div>
In this section, we will see how to send data from applications deployed in ECS to
SigNoz Cloud using Daemon Service we created in the previous section.

### Step 1: Add OpenTelemetry Instrumentation to your Application

To add OpenTelemetry instrumentation to your application, you can follow the
docs [here](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/).

<Admonition>
This step include adding the [OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/)
as well as the initialization code to your application codebase and rebuilding the application
container image.
</Admonition>

### Step 2: Add Entrypoint to your Application Container

We need to add an entrypoint to the application container to set the
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable to the endpoint of the
daemon service. Such that the application container can send data to the
daemon container running in the same host.

**Method 1: Updating entrypoint in task definition**

We need to obtain the endpoint or IP address of the instance on which the task
is running. We can do this by querying the metadata service of the instance.
For EC2, the metadata service is available at `169.254.169.254`.

The `entryPoint` will look like:

```
{
       
      "entryPoint": [
        "sh",
        "-c",
        "export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=\"http://$(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4):4317\"; <Application Startup Commands>"
      ],
			"command": [],
			
}
```

- Replace `<Application Startup Commands>` with the commands to start your application.

**Method 1: Updating entrypoint in task definition**

We need to obtain the endpoint or IP address of the instance on which the task
is running. This can be done by multiple ways depending on the network mode and cloud provider.

The `entryPoint` will look like the following based on your network mode and cloud provider:

- Using default networking mode i.e. **Bridge**:
    
    ```json
    {
           
          "entryPoint": [
            "sh",
            "-c",
            "export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=\"http://172.17.0.1:4317\"; <Application Startup Commands>"
          ],
    			"command": [],
    			
    }
    ```
    
- Using **Bridge** mode with custom docker network
    
    If you are using custom docker networking, you would have to use `ExtraHosts` in your task definition. 
    
    ```json
    {
        
        "extraHosts": [
          {
            "hostname": "signoz-collector",
            "ipAddress": "host-gateway"
          }
          
        ]
    }
    ```
    
    And the `entryPoint` will look like:
    
    ```json
    {
           
          "entryPoint": [
            "sh",
            "-c",
            "export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=\"http://signoz-collector:4317\"; <Application Startup Commands>"
          ],
    			"command": [],
    			
    }
    ```
    
- If network mode is not **Bridge**, and AWS EC2 instance:
    
    ```json
    {
           
          "entryPoint": [
            "sh",
            "-c",
            "export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=\"http://$(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4):4317\"; <Application Startup Commands>"
          ],
    			"command": [],
    			
    }
    ```
    
- If network mode is not **Bridge**, and GCP instance:
    
    ```json
    {
           
          "entryPoint": [
            "sh",
            "-c",
    				'export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://$(curl "http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/network-interfaces/0/ip?recursive=true&alt=text" -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google"):4317"; <Application Startup Commands>'
          ],
    			"command": [],
    			
    }
    ```

**NOTES:**
- Replace `<Application Startup Commands>` with the commands to start your application.

### 3. Add Service Name of your Application

To add the service name of your application, you need to set the
`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable of the application container
to `service.name=<your-service-name>`.

In your task definition, you can add the following lines.

```yaml

    ContainerDefinitions:
        - Name: <your-container-name>
          
          Environment:
            - Name: OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES
              Value: service.name=<your-service-name>
          

```

In case of JSON task definition, you can add the following lines.

```json

    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "name": "<your-container-name>",
            
            "environment": [
                {
                    "name": "OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES",
                    "value": "service.name=<your-service-name>"
                }
            ],
            
        }
    ],


```
