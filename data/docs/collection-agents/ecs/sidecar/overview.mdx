## What is ECS Serverless Collection?

This documentation explains how to collect metrics, traces, and logs from your Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) infrastructure using a sidecar container approach in ECS Cluster for Serverless Services. The sidecar method involves deploying an additional container (the "sidecar") that runs in each application container of your ECS cluster running Serverless Services to collect telemetry data and forward it to SigNoz.
The sidecar approach involves deploying a specialized container that:

## How It Works


1. **Runs alongside applications**: The sidecar container runs within the same ECS task as your application containers
2. **Collects infrastructure data**: Gathers ECS container metrics and forwards any received OTLP data
3. **Acts as a gateway**: Receives OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) telemetry data from your applications
4. **Forwards to SigNoz**: Sends all collected data to your SigNoz instance for visualization and analysis

## Architecture Overview

```
ECS Serverless Task
├── Your Application Container(s)
├── Sidecar Container (OpenTelemetry Collector)
│   ├── Collects ECS container metrics
│   ├── Receives OTLP data from apps
│   └── Forwards data to SigNoz
└── Log Router Container (Fluent Bit) - Optional
    └── Routes application logs to sidecar
```

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the sidecar collection, ensure you have:

- **ECS Cluster**: An active ECS cluster with at least one task definition
- **Launch Type**: Your ECS cluster can use any launch type: **Fargate**, **EC2**, or **External**
- **SigNoz Instance**: Either SigNoz Cloud account or self-hosted SigNoz installation
- **AWS CLI**: Configured with appropriate permissions for ECS and Parameter Store operations
- **IAM Permissions**: Access to create ECS task definitions, Parameter Store resources, and CloudWatch Logs

## What Data Gets Collected?

The sidecar container collects several types of data:

### Infrastructure Metrics
- ECS container metrics from the ECS Task Metadata Endpoint
- Container-level resource consumption
- Task and service-level metrics

### Application Telemetry
- Traces from instrumented applications via OTLP
- Custom metrics from your services
- Any OTLP-compatible telemetry data

### Application Logs (Optional)
- Application logs routed through Fluent Bit log router
- Structured and unstructured log data
- ECS metadata attached to logs

## Launch Type Support

### Fargate Launch Type
- Full support for sidecar container deployment
- No direct host access required
- Container runs within the task's network namespace
- Ideal for serverless container workloads

### EC2 Launch Type
- Full support for sidecar container deployment
- Can leverage host networking if needed
- More control over resource allocation
- Good for performance-critical workloads

### External Launch Type
- Supported for external compute resources
- Similar functionality to other launch types
- May require additional network configuration
- Good for hybrid cloud setups
