description: Learn how to Configure JWT Secret in SigNoz as an administrator
---


SigNoz uses a JWT secret key to sign and verify all user session tokens. **It is critical to set this secret to ensure the security of your SigNoz instance.**

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning: JWT Secret Not Set">
If you do not set the JWT secret, SigNoz will not fail to start; it will only print a warning log:
```bash
No JWT secret key is specified
```
Running without a secret leaves your instance exposed and anyone can forge valid tokens with an empty string.

</Admonition>

## How to Set the JWT Secret

1. **Choose a Strong Secret:**  
   Use a long, random string. Avoid using simple or guessable values.

2. **Set the Environment Variable:**  
   Set the following to your environment configuration:

   ```bash
   SIGNOZ_JWT_SECRET=your-very-strong-random-secret
   ```

3. **Restart SigNoz:**  
   After setting the variable, restart your SigNoz services to apply the change.

## Best Practices

- **Never share your JWT secret publicly.**
- **Rotate the secret periodically** and update your environment configuration accordingly.
- **Monitor logs** for any warnings about missing or invalid JWT secrets.
