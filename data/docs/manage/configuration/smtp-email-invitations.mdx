title: Enable SMTP for Email Invitations
description: Learn how to Configure SMTP for Email Invitations
---

SigNoz allows you to configure email settings using environment variables. SigNoz uses email to send user invitations. To enable email, you need to set the following environment variables:

- `SMTP_ENABLED`: Enable SMTP for sending email invitations.
- `SMTP_FROM`: The email address from which the invitations will be sent.
- `SMTP_HOST`: The SMTP host obtained from your email provider.
- `SMTP_PORT`: The SMTP port obtained from your email provider.
- `SMTP_USERNAME`: The SMTP user obtained from your email provider.
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: The SMTP password obtained from your email provider.

<Admonition type="warning">

For now, email configuration does not adhere to the configuration options outlined in the [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) section. They are slated to be deprecated in the future and moved to the new configuration system. See [Issue#9805](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/9805) on Github for updates.
