## Enhanced PromQL Syntax

We're excited to announce that our monitoring platform now supports **UTF-8 characters in Prometheus metric and label names**! This enhancement enables compatibility with OpenTelemetry that use characters like dots (`.`) in metric names.

## What's Changed

Due to our ongoing migration to support UTF-8 metric names, **PromQL queries will use new format**. This change allows us to handle metrics with previously unsupported characters while maintaining full backward compatibility.

### New Syntax Overview

The key changes include:
- **Quoted metric names**: Metrics with special characters (like dots) are now enclosed in quotes within curly braces
- **Quoted label names**: Labels containing special characters are similarly quoted
- **Unified selector syntax**: All selectors now use the `{...}` format for consistency

## Key Syntax Rules

1. **Quoted strings**: Metric names with special characters must be quoted using double quotes
2. **First parameter**: The metric name (without a label operator) should be the first parameter inside the curly braces
3. **Label quoting**: Label names containing special characters also need quotes
4. **Backward compatibility**: Traditional metric names (letters, numbers, underscores only) continue to work as before
5. All pre-existing queries will continue to work. If a metric has no previously-invalid characters

```promql
# the new syntax is:
{"my.noncompliant.metric", "noncompliant.label"="value"}
```

## Migration Examples

Here are some common query patterns and their new equivalents:

### Example 1: Container CPU Utilization
```promql
# Old format
sum(rate(container_cpu_utilization{k8s_namespace_name="ns"}[5m])) by (k8s_pod_name)

# New format
sum by ("k8s.pod.name") (rate({"container.cpu.utilization","k8s.namespace.name"="ns"}[5m]))
```

### Example 2: Histogram Quantile
```promql
# Old format
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(request_duration_bucket{job="api"}[5m])) by (le))

# New format
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (le) (rate({"request.duration.bucket",job="api"}[5m])))
```

### Example 3: Complex Query with Functions
```promql
# Old format
max_over_time(foo_bar_total{env=~"prod|stag"}[1h] offset 30m) / ignoring(instance) group_left sum(rate(other_metric[5m])) without (pod)

# New format
max_over_time({"foo.bar.total",env=~"prod|stag"}[1h] offset 30m) / ignoring ("instance") group_left () sum without ("pod") (rate({"other.metric"}[5m]))
```

### Example 4: Metrics and attributes without dot in their name

For queries which don't have metrics and attributes containing dot in the name, any below format will work, but still we urge to use the ```New format``` for consistency.

```promql
# Old format
sum by (foo_attr) (
  rate(foo_bar_total{env=~"prod|stage"}[1h] offset 30m)
)

# New format
sum by ("foo_attr") (
    rate({"foo_bar_total", env =~"prod|stage"}[1h] offset 30m)
)

# both format will work
```

### Example 5: Examples by each metric type
```promql

#COUNTER

# Old format
rate(http_requests_total{job="api",status!~"5.."}[5m])

# New format
rate({"http_requests_total", job="api", status!~"5.."})[5m])

#GAUGE

# Old format
avg_over_time(kube_pod_container_resource_requests_cpu_cores{namespace="prod"}[10m])

# New format
avg_over_time({"kube_pod_container_resource_requests_cpu_cores",namespace="prod"}[10m])

#Histogram

# Old format
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{job="api"}[5m])) by (le))

# New format
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (le) (rate({"http_request_duration_seconds.bucket",job="api"}[5m])))

#Summary
# Old format
sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m])) / sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m]))

# New format
sum(rate({"http_request_duration_seconds.sum"}[5m])) / sum(rate({"http_request_duration_seconds.count"}[5m]))

```

For Histogram metrics we will be adding .min, .max, .count, .bucket, .sum suffices instead of previous ```_``` suffices.
Same goes for Summary metrics we will be adding .count, .quantile, .sum suffices.


## Migration Support

### For Self-Hosted Users
- **Migration scripts**: We will provide automated scripts to convert existing PromQL queries in your dashboards and alerts
- **Gradual rollout**: The new syntax will be introduced incrementally to minimize disruption
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples will be available

### For Cloud Users
- **Automatic migration**: We have already migrated your existing queries to the new format
- **No action required**: Your dashboards and alerts should continue working seamlessly
- **Monitoring**: Our team is actively monitoring the migration to ensure smooth operation

## Benefits of the New Syntax

✅ **Full UTF-8 support**: Use any Unicode characters in metric and label names
✅ **OpenTelemetry compatibility**: Seamless integration with modern observability tools
✅ **Improved clarity**: Consistent quoting syntax reduces ambiguity
✅ **Future-proof**: Compatible with upcoming PromQL enhancements

## Need Help?

- **Questions**: Contact our support team for assistance with query migration
- **Documentation**: Detailed migration guides available in our knowledge base
- **Migration scripts**: Will be provided for bulk query conversion

## Backward Compatibility

Don't worry! The new system maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing queries with traditional metric names continue to work
- Migration is non-breaking for existing workflows
- Scripts will be shared to migrate old promQL queries, for those dashboards and alerts which will now contain previously-invalid characters post migration
