#### Overview

If you are running your applications on a Windows environment, you can stream logs from Windows Event Log to SigNoz using the OpenTelemetry Collector.

Monitoring specific Event Log sources, known as Channels, can be effectively achieved using the Windows Event Log receiver. This receiver is configured in the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file to monitor various channels, ensuring comprehensive event logging and system monitoring. Key channels typically monitored include:

- Application: Logs events related to applications running on the system.
- Security: Records security-related events such as login attempts and resource access.
- System: Captures events related to system components, drivers, and services.

#### Prerequisites

- [Opentelemetry Collector](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/)
- Microsoft User account with permissions to access EventLog
- Microsoft User account with permissions to create Services

#### Procedure

**Step 1: Add windowseventlog receiver**

Open the `config.yaml` file and inside receiver block add

```bash
receivers:
    windowseventlog/application:
        channel: application
    windowseventlog/system:
        channel: system
```

**Step 2: Add these receivers in the service pipeline config inside config.yaml**

```
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [ windowseventlog/application, windowseventlog/system ]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

If there are no errors your logs will be exported and visible on the SigNoz UI.
