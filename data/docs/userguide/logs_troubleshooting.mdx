This troubleshooting guide includes step-by-step instructions that should resolve most issues with logs.

## Schema Migrator: Dirty database version

If you are migrating from older version of SigNoz to `V0.49.1` or `V0.50.0`, you might encounter issue with `signoz-schema-migrator` where it fails to run
and results in an error message like this.
```
Dirty database version 10. Fix and force version.
```
Similar error messages include
```
Dirty database version 11. Fix and force version.
```
```
Dirty database version 12. Fix and force version.
```

To fix this issue, first disable the schema migrator.
* On k8s you can delete the job.
* On Docker you can delete the schema migrator container.

#### Run The Migrations Manually
* Exec into the clickhouse container.
* Start the clickhouse client by running `clickhouse client`
* Check the mutations table and clear it.
    * Check the running mutations
        ```
        select * from system.mutations where is_done=0
        ```
    * If some mutation is stuck with error message you can kill it by running.
        ```sql
        KILL MUTATION where mutation_id='<mutation_id>'
        ```
    * If you have any doubt's please reach out to us on our community [slack](https://signoz.io/slack)
* Run the migrations manually by running each command from the below files on the clickhouse console. If the 10th migration failed then start with 10th, else start with the version where it failed.
    * 10:- https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz-otel-collector/blob/main/migrationmanager/migrators/logs/migrations/000010_body_ngram.up.sql
    * 11:- https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz-otel-collector/blob/main/migrationmanager/migrators/logs/migrations/000011_add_instrumentation_scope.up.sql
    * 12:- https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz-otel-collector/blob/main/migrationmanager/migrators/logs/migrations/000012_rename_instrumentation_scope.up.sql
    * 13:- https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz-otel-collector/blob/main/migrationmanager/migrators/logs/migrations/000013_rename_instrumentation_scope.up.sql
    <br></br>
    While running them replace `{{.SIGNOZ_CLUSTER}}` with cluster.
* Once the commands run successfully, update the schema migrations table.
    * Truncate the schema_migrations table
        ```sql
        truncate table signoz_logs.schema_migrations
        ```
    * Insert data to the migrations table
        ```
        insert into signoz_logs.schema_migrations values (1 ,1 ,1720103647412982569), (1 ,0 ,1720103647810031709), (2 ,1 ,1720103647811955242), (2 ,0 ,1720103647869983948), (3 ,1 ,1720103647875299543), (3 ,0 ,1720103648053893053), (4 ,1 ,1720103648055714316), (4 ,0 ,1720103648113219798), (5 ,1 ,1720103648115626118), (5 ,0 ,1720103648678466995), (6 ,1 ,1720103648680332053), (6 ,0 ,1720103648795967894), (7 ,1 ,1720103648797859904), (7 ,0 ,1720103648967002426), (8 ,1 ,1720103648969563518), (8 ,0 ,1720103649251171410), (9 ,1 ,1720103649252821091), (9 ,0 ,1720103649365897523), (10 ,1 ,1720103649367680188), (10 ,0 ,1720103660451466954), (11 ,1 ,1720103660454458733), (11 ,0 ,1720103661073573745), (12 ,1 ,1720115099220469277), (12 ,0 ,1720115146203106526), (13 ,1 ,1720115146205945060), (13 ,0 ,1720115146319582687)`
        ```
#### Verify The Changes
    * Check the schema of logs table by running
        ```sql
        show create table signoz_logs.logs format Vertical;
        ```
        The following should be present in the above response
        ```sql
            `scope_name` String CODEC(ZSTD(1)),
            `scope_version` String CODEC(ZSTD(1)),
            `scope_string_key` Array(String) CODEC(ZSTD(1)),
            `scope_string_value` Array(String) CODEC(ZSTD(1)),
            ...
            INDEX body_idx lower(body) TYPE ngrambf_v1(4, 60000, 5, 0) GRANULARITY 1,
            ...
            INDEX scope_name_idx scope_name TYPE tokenbf_v1(10240, 3, 0) GRANULARITY 4,
            ...
        ```
    * Check the schema of distributed_logs table by running
        ```sql
        show create table signoz_logs.distributed_logs format Vertical;
        ```
        The following should be present in the above response
        ```sql
            `scope_name` String CODEC(ZSTD(1)),
            `scope_version` String CODEC(ZSTD(1)),
            `scope_string_key` Array(String) CODEC(ZSTD(1)),
            `scope_string_value` Array(String) CODEC(ZSTD(1)),
        ```
    * Check the schema of tag_attributes table
        ```sql
        SHOW CREATE TABLE signoz_logs.tag_attributes
        ```
        The following should be present in the above response
        ```sql
        `tagType` Enum8('tag' = 1, 'resource' = 2, 'scope' = 3) CODEC(ZSTD(1)),
        ```

Once verified run the schema migrator again
* On k8s run helm upgrade.
* On Docker rerun the docker compose file.

## Filter logs of same application/service from different host
If you have a application/service which is emitting similar kind of logs but there are multiple instances of it running on different
hosts you can identify them by adding a resource attribute.

There are different ways to add a resource attribute.

1. By passing it as an environment variable if you are using the opentelemtry SDK or auto-instrumentation
    ```
    OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name>,hostname=<host_name>
    ```
    replace the value of `<service_name>` with the actual service name and `<host_name>` with the actual hostname
2. If you have a otel collector running on each host you can add a processor to add the hostname.
    ```yaml
    processors:
        attributes/add_hostname:
            actions:
                - key: hostname
                  value: <hostname>
                  action: upsert
    ...
    service:
        logs:
            processors: [attributes/add_hostname, batch]
    ```
    replace the value of `<host_name>` with the actual hostname

## Missing Columns Issue

In case you are using signoz version `0.27` or newer and in the past you ran the migration `0.27` 
You may face missing columns issue if you are using distributed clickhouse with multiple shards.

To solve this issue, exec into all the shards and follow the steps below:

```sql
show create table signoz_logs.distributed_logs
```

If in one shard the name of a column is `host_name` and 
in other shard the name is `attribute_string_host_name` then run the following command

```sql
alter table signoz_logs.distributed_logs on cluster cluster rename column if exists host_name to attribute_string_host_name
```

Run the above command for all the column names which were not migrated.



## K8s Attribute Filtering Issue in Logs

In the SigNoz charts releases `v0.9.1`, `v0.10.0` and `0.10.1`, some users who are facing
issues querying the following selected fields.

- `k8s_container_name`
- `k8s_namespace_name`
- `k8s_pod_name`
- `k8s_container_restart_count`
- `k8s_pod_uid`


If you have included any of the above to `selected` fields, and you get empty data
when you filter using those fields then you will have to perform the following steps.

- Exec into your clickhouse container
    ```bash
    kubectl exec -n platform -it chi-my-release-clickhouse-cluster-0-0-0 -- sh

    clickhouse client
    ```
- Run the following queries
    
    ```
    use signoz_logs;
    
    show create table logs;
    ```
    
- For the corresponding field, you will find a materialized column and an index.
For example: `k8s_namespace_name` you will have `k8s_namespace_name String
MATERIALIZED attributes_string_value[indexOf(attributes_string_key,
'k8s_namespace_name')] CODEC(LZ4)` and index `INDEX k8s_namespace_name_idx
k8s_namespace_name TYPE bloom_filter(0.01) GRANULARITY 64`
- You will have to delete the index and remove the materialized column
    
    ```
    alter table logs drop column k8s_namespace_name;
    alter table logs drop index k8s_namespace_name_idx;
    ```
    
- Perform the above steps for all the k8s fields listed.
- Once done truncate the attribute keys table
    
    ```
    truncate table logs_atrribute_keys;
    ```
    
- Now you can go back to the UI and convert them back to the selected field, and filters will work as expected.
