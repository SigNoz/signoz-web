description: How to use full-text search in SigNoz logs.
---

Full-text search allows you to search through log body content without specifying field names. This guide covers all aspects of text searching in SigNoz.

**Note:** Full-text search is only supported for logs currently and searches only in the log body field.

## Quoted Text

Use quotes for exact phrase matching in the log body:
```
'failed to connect to database'
```

This finds logs where the body contains the exact phrase "failed to connect to database".

## Unquoted Text

Without quotes, each word is searched separately in the log body:
```
error database connection
```

This searches for logs where the body contains 'error' AND 'database' AND 'connection' (not necessarily together).

## Escaping Special Characters

When searching for text that contains special characters, enclose your search in single quotes and escape only these two characters:
- Single quotes: Use `\'` 
- Backslashes: Use `\\`

Examples:
```
# Searching for text with single quotes
'user\'s email address'
'can\'t connect to database'
'it\'s working'

# Searching for text with backslashes
'C:\\Program Files\\App'
'escape sequence: \\n'
'path\\to\\file'

# Combining both
'user\'s path: C:\\Users\\John'
```

Note: You don't need to escape other special characters like double quotes, brackets, or symbols when they're inside single quotes:
```
# These work without escaping
'error: "connection failed"'
'array[index] = value'
'status != 200'
'price: $99.99'
```

## Regular Expressions

You can use any valid [RE2 syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/syntax) as the full text search.

### Examples

Match structured log entries:
```
'^\[SnapshotGenerator id=\d+\] Creating new KRaft snapshot file snapshot \d+-\d+ because .+ \d+ bytes\.$'
```

This matches log records with body like:
```
[SnapshotGenerator id=1] Creating new KRaft snapshot file snapshot 00000000000001109202-0000000001 because we have replayed at least 2800 bytes.
[SnapshotGenerator id=1] Creating new KRaft snapshot file snapshot 00000000000001109163-0000000001 because we have replayed at least 2800 bytes.
[SnapshotGenerator id=1] Creating new KRaft snapshot file snapshot 00000000000001109124-0000000001 because we have replayed at least 2800 bytes.
[SnapshotGenerator id=1] Creating new KRaft snapshot file snapshot 00000000000001108539-0000000001 because we have replayed at least 2800 bytes.
[SnapshotGenerator id=1] Creating new KRaft snapshot file snapshot 00000000000001108305-0000000001 because we have replayed at least 2800 bytes.
```

Match logs where the body contains email addresses:
```
'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}'
```

## Combining Full-Text with Field Searches

You can combine full-text search (on log body) with field-based filtering:
```
'payment failed' AND service.name = 'payment-service'
```

This finds logs where the body contains "payment failed" AND the service name is 'payment-service'.

## Important: When to Use Quotes

Always use quotes when:
1. Searching for exact phrases
2. Your search term contains special characters or operators
3. You want to search for operator keywords as text

Examples where quotes are necessary:
```
# Wrong - AND will be treated as boolean operator
searching for AND operator

# Correct - searches for the phrase including 'AND'
'searching for AND operator'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use quotes for phrases** - Always quote multi-word searches unless you want each word searched separately
2. **Be specific** - More specific searches perform better than broad ones
3. **Combine with fields** - Add field filters to narrow down results
4. **Test regex patterns** - Complex regex can be slow; test and optimize
5. **Escape properly** - Only escape single quotes and backslashes inside quoted strings
