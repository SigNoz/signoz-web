## Overview

The **Host Metrics dashboard** consists of charts for monitoring instance metrics and 
is designed as a generic dashboard with a hostname variable. 
You can access detailed information on common host system metrics such as:

- CPU Usage
- Memory Usage
- Disk I/O
- Filesystem Usage
- Network I/O

A full list of supported hostmetrics can be found <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver/README.md#getting-started" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >here</a>.

## Setup

You can choose from the two options below.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SigNoz Cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

A receiver serves as the entry point for data into the OpenTelemetry Collector. 
The Host Metrics receiver collects metrics about the host system from various sources, such as files located in paths like `/sys/block/sda/size` and `/proc/...` on the host machine. It reads and formats the data from these sources into an OTLP-compatible format. This receiver is intended to be used when the OpenTelemetry Collector is deployed as an agent.

Follow the below steps to set up the HostMetrics Dashboard on the SigNoz UI.

**Step 1** : Setup OTel Collector as an agent

Follow the steps in **SigNoz Cloud section** of this <a href = "https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >tutorial</a> to get your Otel Collector agent up and running.

**Step 2** : Download/Copy the hostmetrics JSON file

Hostmetric JSON file will help you create a pre-built dashboard about all the <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver/README.md#getting-started" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >categories</a> of host metrics provided by hostmetrics receiver.

Use this <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/hostmetrics/hostmetrics-with-variable.json" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >GitHub Link</a> to download/copy the `hostmetrics-with-variable.json` file. The structure of the JSON file is shown below.

    <figcaption><i>Structure of hostmetrics-with-variable.json</i></figcaption>
</figure>


**Step 3** : Import hostmetrics JSON file to SigNoz Cloud

Open your SigNoz Cloud UI and go to the **Dashboards** section. 
In the top right corner, click on the **+ New Dashboard** button and 
select the Import JSON option from the dropdown menu.

    <img src="/img/hostmetrics-new-dashboard.webp" alt="How to create a New Hostmetrics Dashboard in SigNoz UI"/>
    <figcaption><i>Create a New Dashboard by importing JSON</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Upload/paste your `hostmetrics-with-variable.json` data and click on **Load JSON** button

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/hostmetrics-load-json.webp" alt="Load the Hostmetrics Dashboard JSON file in SigNoz UI"/>
    <figcaption><i>Load the Hostmetrics JSON file</i></figcaption>
</figure>


After loading the JSON, you can find your hostname in the  **<i>$hostname</i>** dropdown menu. 
Select it, and you'll access the Hostmetrics Dashboard for the VM where you've configured the OTel collector.

<TabItem value="Self-Host" label="Self-Host">

A receiver serves as the entry point for data into the OpenTelemetry Collector. 
The Host Metrics receiver collects metrics about the host system from various sources, such as files located in paths like `/sys/block/sda/size` and `/proc/...` on the host machine. It reads and formats the data from these sources into an OTLP-compatible format. This receiver is intended to be used when the OpenTelemetry Collector is deployed as an agent.

There are two ways in which the Self-Host version of SigNoz can be configured:

- SigNoz is installed on the same VM as your application
- SigNoz is installed on a different VM

#### On Same VM

When SigNoz is running on the same VM as the Host, it automatically starts collecting 
the Hostmetrics data because the hostmetrics receiver is enabled by default in the 
OTel collector that comes bundeled with SigNoz.

    <figcaption><i>HostMetrics collection process for Self-Host SigNoz on same VM</i></figcaption>
</figure>



#### On Different VM
When SigNoz runs on a different VM, you must configure the OTel Collector 
with the hostmetrics receiver enabled on each VM where you want to collect 
Hostmetrics data. This data is subsequently sent to SigNoz.

</figure>



Follow the below steps to set up the HostMetrics Dashboard on SigNoz UI.

**Step 1** : Setup OTel Collector as an agent

<Admonition>
If SigNoz is installed on **Same VM** as host, you don't need to do this step.
