Host metrics are fundamental performance indicators collected directly from a system's operating system. These metrics provide granular visibility into the physical
or virtual server's resource utilization and health status. Every host system in your environment - whether physical machines, virtual machines (VMs), cloud instances,
or containerized nodes collects these metrics directly from its local operating system. 
The OpenTelemetry hostmetrics receiver collects metrics on CPU, memory, disk, network, paging, swap, and system performance.

For more information about the metrics collected by the hostmetrics receiver, see documentation [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver/README.md).

## Step 1: Setup OpenTelemetry Collector on Your VM

To collect host metrics from virtual machines (VMs), [setup the OpenTelemetry (OTel) collector](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) 
on each VM and configure the `hostmetrics` receiver.
In this step, you will create a `config.yaml` which enables the `hostmetrics` receiver.

## Step 2: Configure Host Metrics Collection

The configuration file that you created in the first step enables the hostmetrics receiver.
Make sure `hostmetrics` is added to the **receivers** and **pipelines** sections in your configuration file by checking if the below codeblocks are in your 
`config.yaml` file.

**Receiver**

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  ...
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 60s
    scrapers:
      cpu: {}
      disk: {}
      load: {}
      filesystem: {}
      memory: {}
      network: {}
      paging: {}
      process:
        mute_process_name_error: true
        mute_process_exe_error: true
        mute_process_io_error: true
      processes: {}
    ...
```

**Pipelines**

```yaml:config.yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    ...
    metrics/internal:
      receivers: [prometheus, hostmetrics]
      processors: [resourcedetection, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    ...
```

For a self-hosted setup, configure the hostmetrics receiver as shown below. Replace `<endpoint>` with the endpoint of your SigNoz collector.

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 60s  # Frequency of metrics collection.
    scrapers:
      cpu: {}
      load: {}
      memory: {}
      disk: {}
      filesystem: {}
      network: {}
processors:
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [env, system]
    system:
      hostname_sources: [os]
extensions:
  health_check:
  zpages:
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "<endpoint>"   # Your SigNoz collector endpoint.
    tls:
      insecure: true
service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      address: 0.0.0.0:8888
  extensions: [health_check, zpages]
  pipelines:
    metrics/hostmetrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics]
      processors: [resourcedetection]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### Step 1: Deploy the SigNoz `k8s-infra` Helm Chart

To collect host metrics from your Kubernetes nodes, use the SigNoz `k8s-infra` [Helm chart](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/). 
This chart deploys an agent on every node to gather and forward system metrics.

### Step 2: Customize Host Metrics Collection

Host metrics collection is enabled by default and can be customized via the `hostMetrics` preset. Adjust the collection interval and enable specific scrapers as needed:

```yaml:values.yaml
hostMetrics:
  collectionInterval: 60s   # Sets metric collection frequency.
  scrapers:
    cpu:
      metrics:
        system.cpu.logical.count:
          enabled: true   # Collect logical CPU count.
        system.cpu.physical.count:
          enabled: true   # Collect physical CPU count.
```

</TabItem>

After applying the appropriate configuration, verify that your host metrics are visible in the Infrastructure Monitoring section under the Hosts tab.

## Output

Once your setup is done, you should see your Hostname in the Hosts tab of **Infrastructure Monitoring** section in SigNoz.

## How Collection Works

<details>

<summary> Toggle to know how hostmetrics collection works </summary>


The `hostmetrics` receiver collects system metrics by interacting with the underlying data sources provided by each operating system. These data sources expose
low-level system statistics, which are collected and processed by the receiver.

Below is a table explaining the different data sources and the collection method for different operating systems:

| OS      | Data Sources                      | Collection Method               |
|---------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Linux   | /proc filesystem, sysfs           | Kernel-exported statistics       |
| Windows | PDH Counters, WMI                 | Performance Monitor              |
| macOS   | Mach APIs, sysctl                 | System framework calls           |

- **Data Sources**: The specific system interfaces or files where metrics are exposed.
- **Collection Method**:	The mechanism or API used to access the data sources and collect metrics.
