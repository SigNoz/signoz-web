Host metrics are fundamental performance indicators collected directly from a system's operating system. These metrics provide granular visibility into the physical
or virtual server's resource utilization and health status. Every host system in your environment - whether physical machines, virtual machines (VMs), cloud 
instances, or containerized nodes collects these metrics directly from its local operating system.

OpenTelemetry `hostmetrics` receiver is used to collect metrics from the host machine. It collects metrics from the following sources:

- CPU
- Memory
- Disk
- Network
- Paging
- Swap
- System

For more information about the metrics collected by the hostmetrics receiver, see documentation [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver/README.md).

## How Collection Works

The `hostmetrics` receiver collects system metrics by interacting with the underlying data sources provided by each operating system. These data sources expose
low-level system statistics, which are collected and processed by the receiver.

Below is a table explaining the different data sources and the collection method for different operating systems:

| OS      | Data Sources                      | Collection Method               |
|---------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Linux   | /proc filesystem, sysfs           | Kernel-exported statistics       |
| Windows | PDH Counters, WMI                 | Performance Monitor              |
| macOS   | Mach APIs, sysctl                 | System framework calls           |

- **Data Sources**: The specific system interfaces or files where metrics are exposed.
- **Collection Method**:	The mechanism or API used to access the data sources and collect metrics.


## Collect host metrics from k8s nodes

To collect host metrics from k8s nodes, you can use the `k8s-infra` [SigNoz Helm chart](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/) to deploy the 
`hostmetrics` receiver. 

The chart runs an agent on each k8s node and collects host metrics. 
Host metrics collection is [enabled by default](https://github.com/SigNoz/charts/blob/f6aa926d43d316968544834347113b2b74a47d90/charts/k8s-infra/values.yaml#L148) 
in the `k8s-infra` Helm chart and can be configured using the `hostMetrics` preset that allows you to enable/disable metrics collection, configure the collection 
frequency, and configure the scrapers.

The following example shows how to configure the `hostMetrics` preset to collect metrics every 60 seconds and enable the CPU scraper to collect optional metrics:

```yaml:values.yaml
hostMetrics:
  collectionInterval: 60s
  scrapers:
    cpu:
      metrics:
        system.cpu.logical.count:
          enabled: true
        system.cpu.physical.count:
          enabled: true
```

## Collect host metrics from Virtual Machines (VMs)

To collect host metrics from virtual machines (VMs), you need to [run OTel collector](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) on each VM and 
configure the hostmetrics receiver to collect metrics from the VM.

The below example shows how to configure the hostmetrics receiver to collect metrics from a VM:

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/).
