title: Stream Logs from Heroku to SigNoz
id: heroku_logs_to_signoz

If you are running your applications on heroku, you can stream logs from Heroku to SigNoz using [httpsdrain](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-drains#https-drains).


## Stream Heroku logs to SigNoz in SigNoz cloud

* Use the heroku cli to add a https drain
    ```sh
    heroku drains:add https://<TENANT_NAME>:<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>@ingest.<REGION>.signoz.cloud:443/logs/heroku -a <YOUR_APP_NAME>
    ```

  Set the values of `<TENANT_NAME>`,  `<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>`, `<REGION>` and `<YOUR APP NAME>`.

  `<TENANT_NAME>` is name of your instance. Ex:- If the url is `https://cpvo-test.us.signoz.cloud` the `TENANT_NAME` is `cpvo-test`.

  `<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>` is the ingestion key.

  `<YOUR_APP_NAME>` is the name of the application where you want to add the drain.

  
  Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the otlp endpoint will vary according to this table.

  | Region | Endpoint                   |
  | ------ | -------------------------- |
  | US     | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
  | IN     | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
  | EU     | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

* Once added you can verify by going to the SigNoz UI.


## Stream Heroku logs to SigNoz in Self-Hosted SigNoz

* Modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file present inside `deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup` to expose a port, in this case `8081`.
    ```yaml {8}
    ...
    otel-collector:
        image: signoz/signoz-otel-collector:0.88.11
        command: ["--config=/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml"]
        volumes:
          - ./otel-collector-config.yaml:/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml
        ports:
          - "8081:8081"
    ...
    ```

* Add the httplogreceiver reciever to `otel-collector-config.yaml` which is present inside `deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup`
    ```yaml {2-10}
    receivers:
      httplogreceiver/heroku:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:8081
        source: heroku
    ...
    ```

* Next we will modify our pipeline inside `otel-collector-config.yaml` to include the receiver we have created above.
    ```yaml {4}
    service:
        ....
        logs:
            receivers: [otlp, httplogreceiver/heroku]
            processors: [batch]
            exporters: [clickhouselogsexporter]
    ```

* Now we can restart the otel collector container so that new changes are applied and we can forward our logs to port `8081`.

* Use the heroku cli to add a https drain
    ```sh
    heroku drains:add http://<IP>:8081 -a <YOUR_APP_NAME>
    ```
    Replace IP with IP of the system where your collector is running.
