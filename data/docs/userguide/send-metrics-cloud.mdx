## Methods to Send Metrics
There are two primary ways to send metrics to SigNoz:

1. From your application
2. From OpenTelemetry Collector

This document will cover sending metrics from the OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A running instance of SigNoz Cloud.
- OpenTelemetry Collector installed.
- Appropriate access and permissions.

In this document, we will cover how to send metrics from OpenTelemetry Collector. The Collector is a swiss-army knife that can collect metrics from various sources and send them to SigNoz.

## How does OpenTelemetry Collector collect data?

Data collection in OpenTelemetry Collector is facilitated through receivers. Receivers are configured via YAML under the top-level `receivers` section. To ensure a valid configuration, at least one receiver must be enabled.

Below is an example of an **`otlp`** receiver:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:
```

The OTLP receiver accepts data through gRPC or HTTP in the <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/docs/specification.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OTLP</a> format. 

Here’s a sample configuration for an otlp receiver:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: "localhost:4318"
        cors:
          allowed_origins:
            - http://test.com
            # Origins can have wildcards with *, use * by itself to match any origin.
            - https://*.example.com
          allowed_headers:
            - Example-Header
          max_age: 7200
```

To see more configuration options for otlp receiver, you can checkout [this link](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/otlpreceiver/README.md).

Once a receiver is configured, it needs to be **enabled** to start the data flow. This involves setting up **pipelines** within a **`service`**. A **pipeline** acts as a streamlined pathway for data, outlining how it should be processed and where it should go. A pipeline comprises of the following:

- **Receivers:** These are entry points for data into the OpenTelemetry Collector, responsible for collecting data from various sources and feeding it into the pipeline.
- **Processors:** Metrics data is processed using the **`batch`** processor. This processor batches metrics before exporting them, optimizing the data flow.
- **Exporters:** Metrics processed through this pipeline are exported to the OTLP endpoint mentioned in the configuration file. 

Below is an example pipeline configuration:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, httpcheck]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Here’s a breakdown of the above metrics pipeline:

- **Receivers:** This pipeline is configured to receive metrics data from two sources: OTLP and HTTP Check. The **`otlp`** receiver collects metrics using both gRPC and HTTP protocols, while the **`httpcheck`** receiver gathers metrics from the HTTP endpoint.
- **Processors:** Metrics data is processed using the **`batch`** processor. This processor likely batches metrics before exporting them, optimizing the data flow.
- **Exporters:** Metrics processed through this pipeline are exported to the OTLP destination. The **`otlp`** exporter sends data to an endpoint specified in the configuration.

## Enable a Specific Metric Receiver

SigNoz supports all the receivers that are listed in the [opentelemetry-collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver) GitHub repository. To configure a new metric receiver, you must edit the `receivers` and `service::pipelines` sections of the `otel-collector-config.yaml` file. The following example shows the default configuration in which the `hostmetrics` receiver is enabled:

```yaml {8-20,52}
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: localhost:4317
      http:
        endpoint: localhost:4318
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 30s
    scrapers:
      cpu: {}
      disk: {}
      load: {}
      filesystem: {}
      memory: {}
      network: {}
      paging: {}
      process:
        mute_process_name_error: true
        mute_process_exe_error: true
        mute_process_io_error: true
      processes: {}
processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 1000
    timeout: 10s
  # Ref: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/resourcedetectionprocessor/README.md
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [env, system, ec2] # include ec2 for AWS, gcp for GCP and azure for Azure.
    # Using OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES envvar, env detector adds custom labels.
    timeout: 2s
    override: false
    system:
      hostname_sources: [os] # alternatively, use [dns,os] for setting FQDN as host.name and os as fallback
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443" # replace {region} with your region
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-access-token": "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
  logging:
    verbosity: detailed
service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      address: localhost:8888
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics/hostmetrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics]
      processors: [resourcedetection, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

To enable a new OpenTelemetry receiver, follow the steps below:

1. Open the `otel-collector-config.yaml` file in a plain-text editor.
2. Configure your receivers. The following example shows how you can enable a `rabbitmq` receiver:

```yaml {21-25,53}
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: localhost:4317
      http:
        endpoint: localhost:4318
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 30s
    scrapers:
      cpu: {}
      disk: {}
      load: {}
      filesystem: {}
      memory: {}
      network: {}
      paging: {}
      process:
        mute_process_name_error: true
        mute_process_exe_error: true
        mute_process_io_error: true
      processes: {}
  rabbitmq:
    endpoint: http://localhost:15672
    username: <RABBITMQ_USERNAME>
    password: <RABBITMQ_PASSWORD>
    collection_interval: 30s
processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 1000
    timeout: 10s
  # Ref: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/resourcedetectionprocessor/README.md
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [env, system, ec2] # include ec2 for AWS, gcp for GCP and azure for Azure.
    # Using OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES envvar, env detector adds custom labels.
    timeout: 2s
    override: false
    system:
      hostname_sources: [os] # alternatively, use [dns,os] for setting FQDN as host.name and os as fallback
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443" # replace {region} with your region
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-access-token": "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
  logging:
    verbosity: detailed
service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      address: localhost:8888
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, rabbitmq]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics/hostmetrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics]
      processors: [resourcedetection, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

## Enable a Prometheus Receiver

SigNoz supports all the exporters that are listed on the [Exporters and Integrations](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) page of the Prometheus documentation. If you have a running Prometheus instance, and you expose metrics in Prometheus, then you can scrape them in SigNoz by configuring Prometheus receivers in the `receivers::prometheus::config::scrape_configs` section of the `otel-collector-config.yaml` file.

To enable a Prometheus receiver, follow the steps below:
1. Open the `otel-collector-config.yaml` file in a plain-text editor.
2. Enable a new Prometheus receiver. Depending on your use case, there are two ways in which you can enable a new Prometheus exporter:
    - **By creating a new job**: The following example shows how you can enable a Prometheus receiver by creating a new job named `my-new-job`:
      ```yaml {10-13}
        ...
        # Data sources: metrics
        prometheus:
          config:
            scrape_configs:
              - job_name: "otel-collector"
                scrape_interval: 30s
                static_configs:
                  - targets: ["otel-collector:8889"]
              - job_name: "my-new-job"
                scrape_interval: 30s
                static_configs:
                  - targets: ["localhost:8080"]
        ...
      # This file was truncated for brevity.
      ```
    - **By adding a new target to an existing job**: The following example shows the default `otel-collector` job to which a new target (`localhost:8080`) was added:
      ```yaml {9}
        ...
        # Data sources: metrics
        prometheus:
          config:
            scrape_configs:
              - job_name: "otel-collector"
                scrape_interval: 30s
                static_configs:
                  - targets: ["otel-collector:8889", "localhost:8080"]       
        ...
      # This file was truncated for brevity.
      ```
    Note that all the jobs are scraped in parallel, and all targets inside a job are scraped serially. For more details about configuring jobs and targets, see the following sections of the Prometheus documentation:
      - [`<scrape_config>`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config)
      - [Jobs and Instances](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/jobs_instances/)
