## Quick Start

The most basic queries look like this:

```
service.name = 'payment-service'
```

You can combine multiple conditions:

```
service.name = 'payment-service' AND http.status_code >= 400
```

For full-text search, simply type what you're looking for:

```
'error connecting to database'
```

Note: Make sure the phrase you want to search is enclosed in single quotes.

## Basic Concepts

### Fields and Values

A query consists of fields (what you're searching in) and values (what you're searching for):

- **Field**: The property name (e.g., `service.name`, `http.status_code`)
- **Value**: What you're comparing against (e.g., `'payment-service'`, `200`)

### Query Structure

Conditions follow this general pattern:

```
field operator value
```

Multiple conditions can be combined with boolean operators:

```
condition1 AND condition2 OR condition3
```

## Common Pitfalls

Avoid these common mistakes when writing queries. Each example shows the incorrect approach followed by the correct syntax.

### 1. Forgetting Quotes for String Values
**Not recommended:** `status = active`  
**Correct:** `status = 'active'`

### 2. Missing Wildcards in LIKE
**Wrong:** `message LIKE 'error'` (exact match only)  
**Correct:** `message LIKE '%error%'` (contains 'error')

### 3. Incorrect Array Syntax
**Wrong:** `region IN 'us-east', 'us-west'`  
**Correct:** `region IN ('us-east', 'us-west')`

### 4. Ambiguous Precedence
**Wrong:** `a = 1 OR b = 2 AND c = 3`  
**Correct:** `a = 1 OR (b = 2 AND c = 3)`

### 5. Case Sensitivity
Remember that `LIKE` is case-sensitive. Use `ILIKE` for case-insensitive matching:
```
# Only matches 'Error' exactly
message LIKE '%Error%'

# Matches 'error', 'ERROR', 'Error', etc.
message ILIKE '%error%'
```

### 6. Special Characters in Search
If searching for special characters or operators as text, always use quotes:
```
# Searching for the literal text 'NOT'
message CONTAINS 'NOT'

# Searching for logs with text [debug]
'[debug]'

# Searching for text with operators
'response != 200'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic field comparisons and add complexity as needed
2. **Test Incrementally**: Build complex queries step by step, testing each addition
3. **Leverage Autocomplete**: Use the UI's autocomplete feature to discover available fields
4. **Quote String Values**: Always quote string values to avoid parsing ambiguities
5. **Parenthesize Complex Logic**: Use parentheses liberally to make intent clear
