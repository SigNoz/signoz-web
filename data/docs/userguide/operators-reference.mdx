This guide provides a comprehensive reference for all operators available in SigNoz search syntax.

## Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `=` | Equals | `status = 'success'` |
| `!=` or `<>` | Not equals | `status != 'failed'` |
| `<` | Less than | `response_time_ms < 1000` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal | `response_time_ms <= 1000` |
| `>` | Greater than | `response_time_ms > 500` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal | `response_time_ms >= 500` |

## String Matching Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `LIKE` | Case-sensitive pattern matching | `message LIKE '%error%'` |
| `NOT LIKE` | Negated LIKE | `message NOT LIKE '%debug%'` |
| `ILIKE` | Case-insensitive pattern matching | `message ILIKE '%ERROR%'` |
| `NOT ILIKE` | Negated ILIKE | `message NOT ILIKE '%DEBUG%'` |

**Pattern matching wildcards:**
- `%` matches any sequence of characters
- `_` matches a single character

## Range and Set Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `BETWEEN` | Value within range | `latency BETWEEN 100 AND 500` |
| `NOT BETWEEN` | Value outside range | `latency NOT BETWEEN 100 AND 500` |
| `IN` | Value in set | `region IN ('us-east', 'us-west')` |
| `NOT IN` | Value not in set | `region NOT IN ('eu-west', 'eu-east')` |

## Advanced Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `EXISTS` | Field exists | `custom.field EXISTS` |
| `NOT EXISTS` | Field doesn't exist | `error.details NOT EXISTS` |
| `CONTAINS` | Contains substring | `message CONTAINS 'timeout'` |
| `NOT CONTAINS` | Doesn't contain | `message NOT CONTAINS 'success'` |
| `REGEXP` | Regular expression match (RE2 syntax) | `email REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'` |
| `NOT REGEXP` | Doesn't match regex (RE2 syntax) | `path NOT REGEXP '^/api/v1'` |

## Operators and Field Existence

This section describes how operators handle missing fields. Not all records contain every field. Understanding how operators behave with missing fields is crucial for accurate queries.

### Positive Operators (Automatically Check Field Exists)

These operators **only match logs where the field exists**:

| Operator | Behavior | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `=` | Field must exist AND equal value | `service.name = 'api'` |
| `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` | Field must exist AND meet condition | `response_time_ms > 500` |
| `LIKE`, `ILIKE` | Field must exist AND match pattern | `message LIKE '%error%'` |
| `BETWEEN` | Field must exist AND be in range | `latency BETWEEN 100 AND 500` |
| `IN` | Field must exist AND be in set | `region IN ('us-east', 'us-west')` |
| `CONTAINS` | Field must exist AND contain text | `body CONTAINS 'timeout'` |
| `REGEXP` | Field must exist AND match regex | `email REGEXP '.*@company.com'` |

**Example:**
```
response_time_ms > 500
```
Matches: Logs with response_time_ms field AND value > 500  
Skips: Logs without response_time_ms field

### Negative Operators (DO NOT Check Field Exists)

These operators match **all logs except those with the specified value** (including logs missing the field):

| Operator | Behavior | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `!=`, `<>` | Match if field doesn't exist OR value differs | `status != 'error'` |
| `NOT LIKE`, `NOT ILIKE` | Match if field doesn't exist OR pattern doesn't match | `message NOT LIKE '%debug%'` |
| `NOT BETWEEN` | Match if field doesn't exist OR value outside range | `latency NOT BETWEEN 100 AND 500` |
| `NOT IN` | Match if field doesn't exist OR value not in set | `region NOT IN ('eu-west')` |
| `NOT CONTAINS` | Match if field doesn't exist OR doesn't contain text | `body NOT CONTAINS 'success'` |
| `NOT REGEXP` | Match if field doesn't exist OR doesn't match regex | `path NOT REGEXP '^/api'` |

**Example:**
```
service.name != 'redis'
```
Matches: 
- Logs where service.name = 'api', 'auth', etc.
- Logs that don't have a service.name field at all

Skips: Only logs where service.name = 'redis'

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Find All Non-Redis Services
**Ambiguous:**
```
service.name != 'redis'
```
This includes logs without any service name!

**Explicit intent:**
```
service.name EXISTS AND service.name != 'redis'
```
This only includes logs that have a service name (and it's not 'redis')

### Scenario 2: Find Logs Without Errors
**Ambiguous:**
```
severity_text != 'ERROR'
```
This includes logs that don't even have an severity_text field!

**Clear intent - exclude ERROR level only:**
```
severity_text EXISTS AND severity_text != 'ERROR'
```

**Clear intent - find logs explicitly marked as non-error:**
```
severity_text IN ('INFO', 'WARN', 'DEBUG')
```

### Scenario 3: Find Failed Requests
**Good:**
```
status_code >= 400
```
Only matches logs that have a status_code field with error values

**Be careful with:**
```
status_code NOT BETWEEN 200 AND 399
```
This would include logs without any status_code field!

## Boolean Operators

- `AND`: Both conditions must be true
- `OR`: At least one condition must be true
- `NOT`: Negates the condition

**Operator Precedence** (highest to lowest):
1. Parentheses `()`
2. `NOT`
3. `AND`
4. `OR`

## Regular Expression (REGEXP)

The `REGEXP` operator uses RE2 syntax for pattern matching. RE2 is a fast, safe regular expression library that guarantees linear time execution. Common patterns:

- `.` - Any single character
- `*` - Zero or more of the preceding element
- `+` - One or more of the preceding element
- `?` - Zero or one of the preceding element
- `[abc]` - Any character in the set
- `[^abc]` - Any character not in the set
- `\d` - Any digit
- `\w` - Any word character (letter, digit, underscore)
- `\s` - Any whitespace character

Examples:
```
# Match email addresses
email REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'

# Match IP addresses
ip_address REGEXP '^\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}$'

# Match URLs starting with https
url REGEXP '^https://'

# Match phone numbers (various formats)
phone REGEXP '^\+?1?\d{3}[-.]?\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}$'
```

Note: RE2 does not support lookahead/lookbehind assertions or backreferences.
