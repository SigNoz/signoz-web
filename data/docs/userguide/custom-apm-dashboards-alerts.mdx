## Auto Generated APM Metrics

SigNoz automatically generates the following APM/RED (Rate, Error, Duration) metrics from traces:

1. `signoz_calls_total`
   - Information on all calls to your services
   - Used to calculate Request Rate and Error Rate for each service, operation, environment, etc.

2. `signoz_latency_sum`
   - Tracks the **total sum of all latency values** recorded
   - Example: If three requests took 1s, 2s, and 3s, the sum would be 6s

3. `signoz_latency_count`
   - Tracks the **number of latency measurements** recorded
   - Example: If 100 requests have been processed, this count would be 100
   - Used in conjunction with `signoz_latency_sum` to calculate average latency (average request duration) by dividing `signoz_latency_sum` by `signoz_latency_count`

4. `signoz_latency_bucket`
   - Tracks how many requests fall into specific latency ranges (buckets)
   - Default buckets: [2ms, 4ms, 6ms, 8ms, 10ms, ... 15s]
   - Counts requests with latency less than or equal to each bucket's value
   - Helps understand how request latencies are distributed across various ranges

5. `signoz_db_latency_sum`
   - Represents the **total sum of all latencies** for database-related operations
   - Helps track the total time spent on database operations

6. `signoz_db_latency_count`
   - Counts the **number of database operations** measured
   - When combined with `signoz_db_latency_sum`, allows calculation of average latency per database operation

7. `signoz_external_call_latency_sum`
   - Tracks the **total sum of latencies** for all external calls
   - Helps track the total time spent waiting for external services

8. `signoz_external_call_latency_count`
   - Counts the **number of external calls** made
   - Combined with `signoz_external_call_latency_sum`, helps calculate the average latency of external calls

Common attributes across these metrics:
- `operation`
- `service_name`
- `span_kind`
- `http_status_code`
- `status_code`
- `deployment_environment`
- `service_namespace`

## APM Metrics Dashboard

SigNoz provides a dashboard template based on the auto-generated metrics. You can import this [JSON dashboard](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/apm/apm-metrics.json) into your SigNoz instance.

The dashboard includes the following charts:
- Latency
- Request Rate
- Error Percentage
- Top operations
- DB Calls RPS
- DB Calls Avg Duration
- Top External Calls

## HTTP API Monitoring Dashboard

This dashboard template is built on top of available [HTTP attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/http/) from OpenTelemetry. You can import this [JSON dashboard](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/apm/http-api-monitoring.json) into your SigNoz instance.

The dashboard includes the following charts:
- Latency(P90) chart for each Endpoint
- HTTP Status code distribution
- Top HTTP Endpoints
- External HTTP APIs

## DB Calls Monitoring Dashboard

This dashboard template is built on top of available [DB client call attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/db/) from OpenTelemetry. You can import this [JSON dashboard](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/apm/db-calls-monitoring.json) into your SigNoz instance.

The dashboard includes the following charts:
- DB Transaction Rate
- Top DB calls
- Slowest DB calls
- DB Call error rate
