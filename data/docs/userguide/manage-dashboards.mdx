This section shows how you can create, update, and remove dashboards.

<Admonition type="tip">

We have shared some commonly used dashboard JSON files [here](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards). You can import them directly to create dashboards in SigNoz.

## Steps to Import a Grafana Dashboard

Status: Experimental


In [0.11.3](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.11.3) release, we have added the ability to import Grafana dashboards. It currently supports importing via JSON and Prometheus as a supported data source. This allows you to easily import any of your pre-existing infrastructure or application metrics dashboards into SigNoz. All the relevant meta and format info, such as Y-axis, legend formatting, etc., is also preserved and transformed to make it work in SigNoz dashboards.

To import the Grafana dashboard:


1. From the sidebar, choose **Dashboards**.
2. Select the **New Dashboard** button.
3. Select the **Import Grafana JSON** option, and then you are given two options

    1. Upload JSON File
    2. Paste JSON below
4. Import the JSON with one of the suggested methods
5. Confirm using the **Load JSON** button on the bottom left.

Once the above steps are completed successfully, you will see a new dashboard, and if there is data matching the PromQL queries, it should work right away.

Note: The imported dashboard might have the variables, and those variables are copied as is from the source. The query type ones do not work since SigNoz supports variable by query using ClickHouse. You might have to update them. Please follow [this](./manage-variables.md) guide for more info.
