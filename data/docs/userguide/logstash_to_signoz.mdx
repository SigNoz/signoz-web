If you use Logstash to collect logs in your stack, this tutorial will help you send logs from Logstash to SigNoz.

At SigNoz, we use the OpenTelemetry collector to receive logs, which supports the TCP protocol. You can forward your logs from your Logstash agent to the OpenTelemetry collector.

### Collect Logs Using Logstash in SigNoz Cloud

1. **Add OpenTelemetry Collector Binary**:
   Add the OpenTelemetry collector binary to your VM by following this [guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/).

2. **Configure the Receiver**:
   Add the receiver to your `config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   receivers:
     tcplog/logstash:
       max_log_size: 1MiB
       listen_address: "0.0.0.0:2255"
       attributes: {}
       resource: {}
       add_attributes: false
       operators: []
   ```
   - Port `2255` is used here for listening via the TCP protocol, but you can use a port of your choice.
   - Learn more about the `tcplog` receiver [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/tcplogreceiver).

3. **Modify the `config.yaml`**:
   Update your service configuration to include the receiver:
   ```yaml {4}
   service:
       ...
       logs:
           receivers: [otlp, tcplog/logstash]
           processors: [batch]
           exporters: [otlp]
   ```

4. **Update Logstash Configuration**:
   Change the Logstash config to forward logs to the OpenTelemetry collector:
   ```
   output {
     tcp {
       codec => json_lines # Ensures logs are sent in JSON format line-by-line
       host => "localhost"
       port => 2255
     }
   }
   ```
   - This config assumes the Logstash binary is running on the same host. Adjust the `host` value if Logstash is running elsewhere.

5. **Start the Services**:
   Once the changes are made, start the OpenTelemetry binary and Logstash. You should see the logs in SigNoz.

6. **Transform Logs**:
   Use OpenTelemetry processors to transform your log model into the [OpenTelemetry log data model](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md). Learn more about available processors [here](/docs/userguide/logs#processors-available-for-processing-logs).

### Collect Logs Using Logstash in Self-Hosted SigNoz

1. **Configure the Receiver**:
   Add the receiver to your `otel-collector-config.yaml` located in `deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup`:
   ```yaml
   receivers:
     tcplog/logstash:
       max_log_size: 1MiB
       listen_address: "0.0.0.0:2255"
       attributes: {}
       resource: {}
       add_attributes: false
       operators: []
   ```
   - Port `2255` is used here for listening via the TCP protocol, but you can use a port of your choice.
   - Learn more about the `tcplog` receiver [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/tcplogreceiver).

2. **Update the Log Pipeline**:
   Modify the `otel-collector-config.yaml` to include the receiver in the logs pipeline:
   ```yaml
   service:
     ...

     logs:
       receivers: [otlp, tcplog/logstash]
       processors: [batch]
       exporters: [clickhouselogsexporter]
   ```

3. **Expose the Port**:
   Update the `docker-compose.yaml` file in `deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup` to expose the port:
   ```yaml
   otel-collector:
     ...
     ports:
       - "2255:2255"
   ```

4. **Update Logstash Configuration**:
   Modify the Logstash config to forward logs to the OpenTelemetry collector:
   ```
   output {
     tcp {
       codec => json_lines # Ensures logs are sent in JSON format line-by-line
       host => "<otel-collector-host>"
       port => 2255
     }
   }
   ```
   - Replace `<otel-collector-host>` with the actual host where the OpenTelemetry collector is running. Refer to the [troubleshooting guide](/docs/install/troubleshooting#signoz-otel-collector-address-grid) for details.

5. **Start the Services**:
   Restart Logstash and SigNoz. You should see the logs in SigNoz.

6. **Transform Logs**:
   Use OpenTelemetry processors to transform your log model into the [OpenTelemetry log data model](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md). Learn more about available processors [here](/docs/userguide/logs#processors-available-for-processing-logs).
