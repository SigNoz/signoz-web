description: Array functions for querying JSON data in SigNoz.
---

This guide covers functions available for querying array fields in SigNoz.

**Note:** Functions are currently supported only for JSON body searches.

## Available Functions

### hasToken() Function

Check if a token is present in a string.

The search term must be a single tokenâ€”meaning a sequence of alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) that appears in the text separated by spaces, punctuation, or at the start/end of the string.
hasToken will only match the term as a whole word, not as a substring inside another word (e.g., matches uuid123 but not abcuuid123xyz)

**Syntax:**
```
has(field, value)
```

**Examples:**
```
has(body, "john@test.com")
has(body, "e8ff7fe2-6f6a-4795-bd7f-d07f8e49d764")
```

### has() Function

Checks if an array contains a specific value.

**Syntax:**
```
has(field, value)
```

**Examples:**
```
has(body.user_ids, 123)
has(body.tags, 'production')
has(body.regions, 'us-east')
```

## Important Notes

1. **Body fields only** - Functions currently work only with JSON body fields (fields prefixed with `body.`) except for the hasToken function.
2. **Array data** - The field must contain an array for these functions to work properly

## Combining with Other Conditions

Functions can be combined with other query conditions:

```
# Find production logs with error status codes
has(body.tags, 'production') AND status_code IN [500, 502, 503]
```

## Common Use Cases

### Filtering by Tags
```
# Find all logs with production tag
has(body.tags, 'production')

## Error Messages

Common errors you might encounter:

- **"unknown function"** - Check function name spelling and case
- **"function expects key and value parameters"** - Ensure you're providing both field and value
- **"function supports only body JSON search"** - Use only with `body.` prefixed fields
