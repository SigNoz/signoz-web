## Overview

The SigNoz Trace API is a robust interface which enables developers to manage and analyze trace data efficiently. This API facilitates various operations:

- **Searching Traces:** Allows users to search for traces based on specific filters. For example, searching for traces based on the error code.

- **Aggregating Traces:** Allows users to aggregate traces based on specific filters. For example, aggregating traces based on the error code.

## API Endpoint

Endpoint for Trace API:

`POST` `https://{URL}/api/v3/query_range`

Replace `{URL}` with your instance URL, e.g., example.signoz.io.

## Prerequisites

Access Token: To access this API, you need an Access Token. Navigate to the `Settings` page in the SigNoz UI and create a new Access Token.

Access Tokens can only be created/managed by users with the `Admin` role. If you don't have the `Admin` role, contact your organization's admin to create an Access Token for you.

## Authentication

Using the Access Token: Add the Access token to your request header as follows: 

```bash
SIGNOZ-API-KEY:{YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}
```

Secure storage and handling of your Access Token is crucial to prevent unauthorized access.
