title: Trace API Payload Model
id: payload-model
---

The SigNoz Trace API uses a JSON payload for queries, which includes various fields and nested fields. This document provides a detailed explanation of each field to help users construct effective queries.

### Top-level  

The top-level of the payload model has the following fields:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|start| Epoch timestamp marking the start of the query range (in milliseconds) |
|end | Epoch timestamp marking the end of the query range (in milliseconds) |
|step | Aggregation interval for the query, specified in seconds |
|variables| Map of variables used in the query |
|compositeQuery | This contains the [**compositeQuery**](#composite-query) which is explained below |

### Composite Query

The `compositeQuery` field consists of:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|queryType| Type of query (e.g., builder, clickhouse, prometheus).Scope of this documentation is limited to **builder** type|
|panelType| Type of panel (e.g., list, graph, table, trace, value) |
|builderQueries | Map of [**builderQuery**](#builder-query) |
|chQueries | Map of [**chQuery**](#ch-query) |

### Builder Query

A `builderQuery` consists of:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|stepInterval| Aggregation interval for query in seconds |
|queryName| Name of the query, should match the key to this map value | 
|dataSource| Source of data, e.g., traces |
|aggregateOperator| Type of aggregation - noop, count, count_distinct, sum, avg, min, max, p05, p10, p20, p25, p50, p75, p90, p95, p99, rate, rate_sum, rate_avg, rate_min, rate_max|
|aggregateAttribute| The [**attribute**](#attribute) against which the aggregateOperator is applied |
|filters| Array of [**filter**](#filter) used for filtering data|
|selectColumns| Array of [**attribute**](#attribute) which is used in list panelType to fetch columns/attributes of list|
|groupBy| Array  of [**attribute**](#attribute) used for groupBy|
|orderBy| Array of [**orderBy**](#order-by) used for ordering data|
|having| Array of [**having**](#having) used for filtering data after aggregation|
|expression| Will be same as query name but different in case of formulas|
|disabled| Specifies if the query is disabled |
|limit| Limit number of results |
|offset| Offset used in pagination |
|pageSize| Number of results per page |

### Ch Query

A `chQuery` consists of:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|query| Clickhouse query |


### Filter

A `filter` consists of:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|items| Array of [**filterItem**](#filter-item)|
|op| Operator defining how filter items are joined (e.g., AND).

### Filter Item

The `filterItem` includes:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|key | Corresponding [**attribute**](#attribute) |
|op| Operators -  =, !=, >, >=, \<, \<=, in, nin, contains, ncontains, regex, nregex, like, nlike, exists, nexists |
|value | Value for the filter, can be empty for some **op** like `exists` and `nexists` |

<Admonition>
The `value` parameter will be empty for `exists` and `nexists`.
</Admonition>

### Attribute

An `attribute` consists of:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|key| Name of the key |
|type| Type of the key, i.e., tag/resource. It is empty for top level fields. (e.g., tag = method, resource = k8s_deployment_name, (empty) = trace_id) |
|dataType| Data type of the key (e.g., string, int64, float64, bool) |
|isColumn| Indicates if it's column, i.e., it would be faster to query using this attribute |

### Order By

An `orderBy` consists of:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|columnName| Name of the attribute/key |
|order| Order of the column (e.g., asc, desc) |

### Having

A `having` consists of:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|columnName| Name of the attribute/key along with aggregate operator (e.g., COUNT(httpMethod)) |
|op| Operators -  =, !=, >, >=, \<, \<= |
|value| Value for the filter |

## Sample Payload 

### For builderQuery with table panelType

This sample payload contains the different fields that we looked at above. It queries the SigNoz Trace API and illustrates how to count distinct `hasError` values and group them by `serviceName` where `hasError` is `true`.

```json
{
    "start": 1702007766000,
    "end": 1702009566000,

        }
    },

            "A": {
                "query": "SELECT stringTagMap['service.name'] AS `service.name`, toFloat64(avg(durationNano)) AS value FROM signoz_traces.distributed_signoz_index_v2 WHERE timestamp BETWEEN {{.start_datetime}} AND {{.end_datetime}} GROUP BY (`service.name`) order by (`service.name`) ASC;"
            }
        }
    }
