# Celery Messaging Queues

Celery is a powerful, production-ready asynchronous task queue for Python, enabling resource-intensive or long-running tasks to execute in the background 
independently from your main application process. It has become especially popular among teams building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs), thanks to 
Pythonâ€™s strong presence in the LLM ecosystem.

SigNoz provides out-of-the-box (OOTB) integration with Celery through spans collected via OpenTelemetry. This integration delivers comprehensive visibility into 
your Celery infrastructure, workers, and tasks, facilitating powerful diagnostics.

## Overview Page

The Celery overview page provides a real-time snapshot of your Celery task infrastructure:

- **Active Tasks by Worker**: Visualize how many tasks each worker is actively executing over time.
- **Worker Online Status**: Instantly see how many Celery workers are currently online.
- **Span-Based Stats**: Get a high-level view of total tasks executed with a breakdown by:
  - All Tasks
  - Failed Tasks
  - Retry Tasks
  - Successful Tasks
- **Stacked Bar Visualization**: For each task state (success, failure, retry), stacked bars show distribution across time.
- **Interactive Filtering**: Filter metrics by task name or click on specific data points to drill into detailed spans and traces.

## Detailed Celery Metrics

Celery metrics are grouped into two primary categories:

### Flower Metrics

These provide a real-time view of active worker performance:

- **Active Tasks by Worker**: Track how many tasks each Celery worker is executing over time.
- **Worker Online Count**: Instantly view the number of currently active Celery workers.
- **Task Activity Trends**: Identify task bursts or idle periods across the cluster.

### Span Based Stats

Quickly analyze task performance and issues:

- **All Tasks**: Total tasks executed with success, failure, and retry counts.
- **Failed Tasks**: Immediate identification of tasks that failed, with direct trace links.
- **Retry Tasks**: Track retry occurrences to address recurring problems.
- **Successful Tasks**: Confirm task completion efficiency.

- **Trace Drill-down**: Clicking task states or latency metrics reveals detailed views of individual tasks, durations, and links to corresponding traces.
- **Trace Analysis**: Easily pinpoint slow or failing tasks by navigating directly to their detailed traces.

Gain deeper insights at the worker level:

- **Tasks per Second by Worker**: Monitor real-time throughput per worker.
- **Worker Error Percentages**: Quickly spot and resolve worker-level errors.
- **Latency by Worker**: Detect latency spikes for proactive troubleshooting.
