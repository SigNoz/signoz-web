## Introduction

The Kafka monitoring feature in SigNoz helps you track key metrics like consumer lag, producer latency, and partition throughput to detect bottlenecks early. By 
automatically discovering producers and consumers instrumented with OpenTelemetry, SigNoz provides a unified view of your event streaming pipelines. From high-level 
metrics down to detailed trace data. Once your services are properly instrumented, you can access Kafka queues, metrics and traces in one place, enabling you to 
pinpoint issues faster, optimize configurations, and maintain high-performing Kafka clusters without extra setup.

## Kafka Tab at a Glance

After navigating to the **Messaging Queues** section, select **Kafka** to access the Kafka overview dashboard.

This dashboard is divided into two key sections:

### Start Sending Data 

Get started with instrumentation and tracking:

- **Configure Consumer** – Add consumer data sources to gain insights and enable monitoring.
- **Configure Producer** – Add producer data sources for full visibility into publish-side performance.
- **Monitor Kafka** – Add your Kafka source to enable activity tracking and system-level metrics.

Each card has a **Get Started** button to guide you through setup.

### Monitor Your Data Streams 

Track essential Kafka metrics using the following dedicated views. Each helps you monitor and troubleshoot specific aspects of your data streams:

- **Consumer Lag View** – Visualize how many messages are yet to be processed by each consumer group across topics and partitions. Useful for identifying slow consumers or uneven partition assignment.
- **Producer Latency View** – Analyze how long producers take to send messages to Kafka, helping detect delays caused by network issues, broker overload, or inefficient batching.
- **Partition Latency View** – Inspect latencies per topic-partition combination to uncover imbalances or hotspots where certain partitions experience higher delays than others.
- **Drop Rate View** – Detect and investigate messages that exceeded predefined latency thresholds. Helps pinpoint time-sensitive messages that were processed too slowly or dropped.
- **Metric View** – Access a comprehensive snapshot of Kafka performance, including metrics from brokers, producers, and consumers, for an overall health check of the system.


## Consumer Lag View

One of the first bottlenecks you’ll want to watch is **consumer lag**—how far behind your consumers are in reading messages from a given topic and partition.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
  <img src="/img/docs/messaging-queues/kafka/consumer-lag-view.webp" alt="Consumer Lag View"/>
  <figcaption><i>Consumer Lag View showing partition-level lag details and service metrics</i></figcaption>
</figure>

This view goes beyond native Kafka metrics by **correlating trace data and partition-level metrics** to show which **producer and consumer instances** are 
contributing to lag. You can also view **P99 latency, error rate, throughput, average message size**, and **network latency** per partition.

### How This Helps You

- **Diagnose Root Causes of Lag**: Identify whether consumer lag is due to high producer throughput or slower consumer processing at the partition level.
- **Analyze Performance**: Gain detailed insights into producer and consumer instances through metrics like p99 latency, error rates, throughput, average message size, and network latency.
- **Optimize Producer Configurations**: Fine-tune settings such as batching, compression, and acknowledgment modes to reduce latency and improve throughput.
- **Scale Consumers Strategically**: Use real-time lag patterns to inform resource allocation, balancing load more effectively across consumer groups.
- **Enhanced Troubleshooting**: Correlate trace data with metrics to pinpoint network latency or processing delays for quicker resolution.

### Detailed Lag Insights Tabs

The **Consumer Lag View** is segmented into three insight-rich tabs:

- **Producer Details**: Highlights which producer services are writing to the selected topic and partition, with P99 latency, error percentage, and throughput.
- **Consumer Groups Details**: Surfaces the consumer service metrics—such as P99, error rate, throughput, and average message size—for each partition.
- **Network Latency**: Displays latency and throughput experienced by specific consumer instances (with Client ID and Instance ID) while processing data. Unlike 
basic latency metrics, SigNoz correlates spans and metrics at the topic and partition level. This correlation helps you pinpoint whether increased lag is due to 
higher throughput from certain producers or slower processing by particular consumers.

### Features

- **Lag Over Time**: See any spikes in lag for each consumer group and partition.
- **Filtering**: Use filters for consumer group, topic, or partition to narrow down where lag is occurring.
- **Correlate Services**: Click a point on the lag chart to reveal exactly which producer and consumer services contribute to that spike.

This correlation helps you pinpoint whether increased lag is due to higher throughput from certain producers or slower processing by particular consumers.

## Partition Latency View

In Kafka, partitions are fundamental units storing messages within queues, organized under topics—logical groupings categorizing these messages. The 
**Partition Latency View** helps you drill down into all topic-partition combinations, clearly visualizing message flow and identifying services interacting with 
each partition.

## Drop Rate View

The **Drop Rate View** lets you set evaluation intervals to quickly identify messages that exceed specified latency thresholds. For example, if you set a threshold 
of 150ms, SigNoz highlights producer-consumer pairs experiencing delays beyond this limit, along with relevant trace IDs for in-depth debugging.

In asynchronous systems, messages might be consumed by multiple services at varying speeds. A single message from a producer could be consumed by several consumer 
services, each processing it at different latencies (e.g., 10ms, 50ms, 180ms). This view provides clear visibility into such interactions and delays, helping 
maintain smooth end-to-end data flow.
