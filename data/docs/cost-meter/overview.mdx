description: Monitor and control observability costs with SigNoz Cost Meter. Gain comprehensive insights into your telemetry data consumption across logs, traces, and metrics with actionable cost optimization recommendations.
---

The **Cost Meter** is SigNoz's comprehensive solution for monitoring and controlling observability costs across all telemetry signals. By providing detailed insights into your data ingestion patterns, Cost Meter helps you understand cost drivers, optimize your observability spend, and make informed decisions about your monitoring strategy.

**What you'll learn:**

- How to monitor costs across different telemetry signals
- Understanding the cost breakdown and key contributors
- Using Cost Meter to optimize your observability spend

---

## Overview

Cost Meter delivers on SigNoz's promise of democratizing observability by providing transparent, actionable insights into your observability costs. Understanding the breakdown of costs across different signals and dimensions is critical for building actionable insights to reduce and optimize your observability spend.

### Key Benefits

- **Cost Transparency**: Clear visibility into your observability costs across all signals
- **Signal-Level Breakdown**: Detailed cost analysis for logs, traces, and metrics
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track costs as they occur with hourly aggregation

## Pricing Model

SigNoz follows a predictable, usage-based pricing model where you are charged based on the telemetry data being ingested in the cloud. This transparent approach ensures you only pay for what you use, with no surprise costs.

  **Important**: Meter data is aggregated over hourly intervals. Queries with time ranges under 1
  hour will not return any data. For real-time analysis, use time ranges of 1 hour or greater.
