description: Monitor and control observability costs with SigNoz Cost Meter. Gain comprehensive insights into your telemetry data consumption across logs, traces, and metrics with actionable cost optimization recommendations.
---

## Overview
The **Cost Meter** is SigNoz's comprehensive solution for monitoring and controlling observability costs across all telemetry signals. By providing detailed insights into your data ingestion patterns, Cost Meter helps you understand cost drivers, optimize your observability spend, and make informed decisions about your monitoring strategy.

### Use Cases:
Some of the use-cases you can achieve with Cost Meter include:
- Monitor costs across different telemetry signals
- Understand the cost breakdown and key contributors
- Optimize your observability spend

### Key Benefits

- **Cost Transparency**: Clear visibility into your observability costs across all signals
- **Signal-Level Breakdown**: Detailed cost analysis for logs, traces, and metrics
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track costs as they occur with hourly aggregation

## Pricing Model

SigNoz follows a predictable, usage-based pricing model where you are charged based on the telemetry data being ingested in the cloud. This transparent approach ensures you only pay for what you use, with no surprise costs.

  **Important**: Meter data is aggregated over hourly intervals. Queries with time ranges under 1
  hour will not return any data. For real-time analysis, use time ranges of 1 hour or greater.

## Cost Meter Dashboard

The Cost Meter homepage is organized into four main sections, each providing specific insights into different aspects of your observability costs:

### 1. Total Overview

The Total section provides a comprehensive view of all cost contributors across your observability stack.
