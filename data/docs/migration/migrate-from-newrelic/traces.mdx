Migrating distributed tracing from New Relic to SigNoz involves replacing New Relic APM agents with OpenTelemetry instrumentation. This guide will walk you through the process for different scenarios.

## Understanding Trace Collection Differences

Before migrating, it's important to understand the key differences between New Relic and SigNoz tracing:

| Feature                | New Relic                                | SigNoz                                | Notes                                               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Collection Method**      | Proprietary APM agents, OpenTelemetry support | OpenTelemetry native                 | SigNoz is built specifically for OpenTelemetry      |
| **Sampling**               | Head-based and tail-based sampling       | Head-based and tail-based sampling    | Both support similar sampling approaches            |
| **Visualization**          | Distributed tracing UI                   | Comprehensive trace analysis UI       | Similar capabilities with different interfaces       |
| **Service Maps**           | Available                                | Available                             | Both provide dependency visualization                |
| **Span Attributes**        | Custom attributes & dimensions           | OpenTelemetry attributes              | Different naming conventions                         |

## Migration Approaches

The approach for migrating traces depends on how you're currently collecting traces in New Relic.

### 1. For Applications Already Using OpenTelemetry with New Relic

If your applications are already instrumented with OpenTelemetry and sending data to New Relic:

1. Update your OpenTelemetry configuration to point to SigNoz instead of New Relic
2. Modify your exporter configuration. Here's a generic example:

```yaml
# Before: New Relic OTLP endpoint
otlp:
  endpoint: "https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317"
  headers:
    "api-key": "NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY"

# After: SigNoz OTLP endpoint
otlp:
  # For SigNoz Cloud
  endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
  headers:
    "signoz-ingestion-key": "<your-ingestion-key>"
  tls:
    insecure: false

  # For Self-hosted SigNoz
  # endpoint: "<signoz-otel-collector>:4317"
  # tls:
  #   insecure: true
```

### 2. Replacing New Relic APM Agents with OpenTelemetry

For applications using New Relic's proprietary APM agents:

1. Remove the New Relic agent from your application
2. Follow the appropriate [SigNoz instrumentation guide](/docs/instrumentation/) for your programming language
3. Configure the OpenTelemetry SDK to send trace data to SigNoz

SigNoz provides detailed instrumentation guides for various languages and frameworks including:
- [Java](/docs/instrumentation/java)
- [Python](/docs/instrumentation/python)
- [Node.js](/docs/instrumentation/nodejs)
- [Go](/docs/instrumentation/golang)
- [Ruby](/docs/instrumentation/ruby)
- [.NET](/docs/instrumentation/dotnet)
- [PHP](/docs/instrumentation/php)
Check this [document](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/) for a list of languages and frameworks
#### Example: Migrating from New Relic Java Agent to OpenTelemetry

**Step 1**: Remove the New Relic Java agent configuration from your application:
- Remove the `-javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar` JVM argument
- Remove any New Relic configuration files (e.g., `newrelic.yml`)

**Step 2**: Add the OpenTelemetry Java agent:
- Download the [OpenTelemetry Java agent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases)
- Add the agent to your JVM arguments:

```bash
java -javaagent:/path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
     -Dotel.service.name=your-service-name \
     -Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://<SigNoz endpoint>:4317 \
     -jar your-application.jar
```

For more detailed instructions, see the [SigNoz Java Instrumentation document](/docs/instrumentation/java).

## Attribute Mapping

When migrating from New Relic to SigNoz, you'll need to map [New Relic's span attributes](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary/) to [OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/trace/). Here are some common mappings:

| New Relic Attribute           | OpenTelemetry Attribute           |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `entity.name`                 | `service.name`                     |
| `entity.type`                 | `service.namespace`                |
| `transactionName`             | `http.route`                       |
| `http.method`                 | `http.request.method`              |
| `http.url`                    | `url.full`                         |
| `http.statusCode`             | `http.response.status_code`        |
| `error.message`               | `exception.message`                |
| `error.class`                 | `exception.type`                   |
| `error.stack`                 | `exception.stacktrace`             |
| `db.statement`                | `db.statement`                     |
| `db.instance`                 | `db.name`                          |
| `span.kind`                   | `span.kind`                        |
| `peer.hostname`               | `server.address`                   |

## Verifying Trace Migration

After migrating your instrumentation, verify that traces are being received correctly:

1. Navigate to the **APM** section in SigNoz
2. Look for your service in the list of services
3. Check basic metrics like p99 latency, error rate, and requests per second
4. Click on your service to view traces
5. Verify that spans are being captured correctly with the expected attributes

Compare key metrics between New Relic and SigNoz during the migration period to ensure data consistency.

## Next Steps

Once your traces are successfully migrating to SigNoz, consider:

- [Creating dashboards](/docs/migration/migrate-from-newrelic/dashboards) with trace-based panels
- [Setting up trace-based alerts](/docs/alerts-management/trace-based-alerts/) for performance and error monitoring
- [Correlating traces with logs](/docs/logs-pipelines/guides/trace/) for comprehensive troubleshooting
- [Exploring the Service Map](/docs/userguide/service-map/) to better understand your application architecture
