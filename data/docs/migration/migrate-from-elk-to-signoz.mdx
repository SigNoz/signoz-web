title: Migrate from ELK Stack
description: Migrating from ELK Stack to SigNoz. How to migrate metrics, traces, and logs from Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana to SigNoz.
---

SigNoz provides a unified [OpenTelemetry](https://signoz.io/why-opentelemetry/) (OTel) native solution for monitoring metrics, traces, and logs, offering a modern alternative with greater flexibility and control over your data compared to the traditional ELK stack. This guide will walk you through the steps to migrate your existing ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, potentially with Elastic APM) setup to SigNoz, covering all essential signals: metrics, traces, and logs.

## Why Migrate to SigNoz?

While the ELK stack has been a popular choice, migrating to SigNoz offers several advantages:

-   **Unified Platform**: SigNoz provides a single, cohesive platform that eliminates the complexity of managing multiple components such as Elasticsearch clusters, Logstash pipelines, and Kibana.
-   **Native OpenTelemetry Support**: Built from the ground up to support OpenTelemetry, ensuring seamless integration with modern instrumentation standards and future-proof observability. ELK requires adapters or specific agents (like Elastic APM) that may not be purely OTel native.
-   **Simplified Operations**: Simple installation and upgrade process reduces the operational overhead and complexity associated with managing and scaling individual ELK components.
-   **Integrated Signals**: SigNoz correlates logs, metrics, and traces out-of-the-box, providing a more seamless debugging experience compared to correlating data across Kibana and potentially separate APM UIs.
-   **Resource Efficiency**: SigNoz often requires fewer resources compared to a similarly scaled Elasticsearch cluster, potentially lowering infrastructure costs.
