### **Core Platform Differences**

| Aspect | Honeycomb | SigNoz |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Philosophy** | Visualizations are built from raw, high-cardinality structured events. | Dashboards are primarily powered by pre-aggregated metrics (time-series data). |
| **Querying** | Uses its own query language to aggregate event data on the fly. | Utilizes **ClickHouse Query Language (ClickQL)** for metrics and logs, and supports PromQL-style querying for metrics. |
| **Visualizations** | Known for unique visualizations like `BubbleUp` for anomaly detection. | Offers a panel-based dashboard experience with standard charts like time series, bar charts, and tables. |
| **Interactivity**| Strong focus on interactive, slice-and-dice data exploration. | Provides interactivity through dashboard variables for dynamic filtering. |

### **Query Language Translation**

Migrating dashboards requires translating Honeycomb's event-based queries into queries against metrics in SigNoz. This often involves using PromQL-like syntax on metrics generated from your telemetry data.

| Use Case | Honeycomb Query | SigNoz Query (PromQL-style) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Request Rate** | `COUNT()` | `sum(rate(signoz_calls_total[5m]))` |
| **Error Rate** | `COUNT() WHERE status_code >= 500` | `sum(rate(signoz_calls_total{http_status_code=~"5.*"}[5m]))` |
| **P95 Latency** | `P95(duration_ms)` | `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(signoz_latency_bucket[5m])) by (le))` |

### **Dashboard Migration Strategy**

A direct, one-to-one migration is often not possible due to platform differences. The recommended approach is to recreate dashboards by focusing on the underlying monitoring goals.

#### **Step 1: Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

Review your Honeycomb dashboards and identify the essential KPIs you are monitoring (e.g., error rates, latency percentiles, request throughput).

#### **Step 2: Build Panels in SigNoz**

For each KPI, create a new panel on a SigNoz dashboard.

  * **Request Rate:** Use a 'Time Series' or 'Stat' panel with a query like `sum(rate(signoz_calls_total{service_name="$service"}[5m]))`.
  * **Error Rate (%):** Use a 'Time Series' or 'Stat' panel with a query like `sum(rate(signoz_calls_total{http_status_code=~"5.*"}[5m])) / sum(rate(signoz_calls_total[5m])) * 100`.
  * **Latency:** Use a 'Time Series' panel to plot multiple percentiles.
      * `histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(signoz_latency_bucket[5m])) by (le, service_name))`
      * `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(signoz_latency_bucket[5m])) by (le, service_name))`

#### **Step 3: Implement Interactivity with Variables**

Recreate Honeycomb's "slice-and-dice" capability by using dashboard variables. This allows users to filter the entire dashboard by dimensions like service name, region, or deployment environment.

A common variable would be `service_name`, which you can define using the query: `label_values(signoz_calls_total, service_name)`.

#### **Step 4: Replicate "BubbleUp" with Drill-Down Links**

While SigNoz doesn't have a direct "BubbleUp" equivalent, you can achieve a similar workflow:

1.  **High-Level Dashboard:** Create a dashboard showing key service metrics.
2.  **Drill-Down Links:** Configure panels to link to more detailed dashboards or to the Traces/Logs pages, passing along the relevant context (like service name and time range) as parameters.

### **Alerting Integration**

Create alert rules directly from your dashboard panels.

1.  Click the bell icon on a panel.
2.  Define the alert conditions and thresholds based on your query.
3.  Configure notification channels (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty).

### **Migration Best Practices**

  * **Focus on Intent:** Don't try to replicate Honeycomb's UI. Instead, focus on recreating the *monitoring capabilities* your team relies on.
  * **Leverage Templates:** SigNoz comes with pre-built dashboard templates for common applications (e.g., Application Overview). Use these as a starting point.
  * **Use Metrics for Dashboards:** Power your dashboards with metrics data, as it is optimized for fast querying over long time ranges.
  * **Organize with Tags:** Use dashboard tags to organize your dashboards by team, service, or environment for easy discovery.
  * **Train Your Team:** Familiarize your team with the new interface and the powerful correlation between metrics, traces, and logs that SigNoz provides.
