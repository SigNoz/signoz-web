Whether you're using Datadog, New Relic, Grafana, ELK, or 
another solution, SigNoz offers an OpenTelemetry Native, developer-first alternative that puts **you** in control.


## Why Migrate to SigNoz?

- **Unified observability:** View all your telemetry data in one UI for end-to-end debugging without tool hopping.
- **OpenTelemetry native:** Built on the open standard from day one, so you instrument once and stay vendor neutral.
- **Flexible deployment options:** [SigNoz Cloud](https://signoz.io/docs/cloud/), [SigNoz Enterprise](https://signoz.io/enterprise/) or [SigNoz Community](https://signoz.io/docs/install/self-host/)
- **Simple, transparent usage-based pricing:** Pay only for the [data you ingest](https://signoz.io/pricing/). No surprise host, agent, or feature add-on fees.
