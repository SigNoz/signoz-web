description: Migrating from LGTM Stack to SigNoz. How to migrate metrics, traces, and logs from LGTM Stack to SigNoz.
---

SigNoz provides a unified OpenTelemetry native solution for monitoring metrics, traces, and logs, allowing for greater flexibility and control over your data. This guide will walk you through the steps to migrate your existing LGTM stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) setup to SigNoz, covering all essential signals: metrics, traces, and logs.

## Migrating Metrics

Migrating metrics from Prometheus/Mimir to SigNoz can be accomplished through several approaches, depending on your current setup and requirements.

### Using Prometheus Receiver in OpenTelemetry Collector

The simplest way to migrate your existing Prometheus/Mimir metrics is to configure the OpenTelemetry Collector with a [Prometheus Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/prometheusreceiver#prometheus-receiver). This allows you to continue using your existing Prometheus exporters while sending the data to SigNoz.

1. [Install the OpenTelemetry Collector](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) in your environment if not already available.
2. Configure the Prometheus Receiver in your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file:
  - [Configuration if using SigNoz Cloud](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/send-metrics-cloud/#enable-a-prometheus-receiver)
  - [Configuration if using Self-Hosted SigNoz](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/send-metrics/#enable-a-prometheus-receiver)

### Replacing Prometheus Exporters with Native OpenTelemetry Receivers

While the Prometheus Receiver allows you to continue using your existing Prometheus exporters, OpenTelemetry offers native receivers for many common systems and services. These provide a more direct integration with the OpenTelemetry ecosystem.

Here are some common Prometheus exporters and their OpenTelemetry equivalents:

| Prometheus Exporter | OpenTelemetry Receiver | Description |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| node_exporter | [hostmetrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver) | Collects system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network) |
| mysqld_exporter | [mysqld](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/mysqlreceiver) | Collects MySQL server metrics |
| redis_exporter | [redis](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/redisreceiver) | Collects Redis metrics |
| mongodb_exporter | [mongodb](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/mongodbatlasreceiver) | Collects MongoDB metrics |
| postgres_exporter | [postgresql](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/postgresqlreceiver) | Collects PostgreSQL metrics |
| kafka_exporter | [kafka](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/kafkametricsreceiver) | Collects Kafka metrics |
| nginx_exporter | [nginx](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/nginxreceiver) | Collects NGINX metrics |

SigNoz supports all the receivers that are listed in the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver GitHub repository. To configure a new metric receiver, follow these instructions for [Self-Hosted SigNoz](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/send-metrics/#enable-a-specific-metric-receiver) or [SigNoz Cloud](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/send-metrics).

### Switching to OTLP Metrics

For new applications or when you're ready to transition away from Prometheus exporters, you can use OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) metrics directly.

1. Instrument your applications with the OpenTelemetry SDK for your programming language.
2. Configure the OTLP Exporter to send metrics to SigNoz, for example if you are using Python:

```python
from opentelemetry import metrics
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.metric_exporter import OTLPMetricExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics import MeterProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics.export import PeriodicExportingMetricReader
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import SERVICE_NAME, Resource

# Service name is required for most backends
resource = Resource(attributes={
    SERVICE_NAME: "your-service-name"
})

reader = PeriodicExportingMetricReader(
    OTLPMetricExporter(endpoint="http://<IP of your Backend>:4317")
)
provider = MeterProvider(resource=resource, metric_readers=[reader])
metrics.set_meter_provider(provider)
```

---

To confirm that the metrics are being sent to SigNoz, you can use the Metrics Explorer in SigNoz. To navigate to Metrics Explorer, simply click `Metrics` on the left sidebar.

The Metrics Explorer page will allow you to easily query metrics using built-in visual query builder. This will enable you to verify that the metrics are being sent correctly to SigNoz, including visualizing them, seeing their descriptions, types, and more.

## Migrating Logs

To migrate logs from Loki to SigNoz, you'll need to reconfigure your log collection agents to send data to SigNoz's OpenTelemetry collectors.

### Using OpenTelemetry Collector for Logs

The most straightforward approach is to use the OpenTelemetry Collector to collect logs directly. Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to collect logs from files, Docker containers, or other sources following [these specific instructions](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-management/send-logs-to-signoz/).

However, unless you already using OpenTelemetry Collector for logs, this approach requires you to update log collection for each individual service or application.

### Using FluentBit with OpenTelemetry

If you're already using FluentBit with Loki, you can reconfigure it to work with OpenTelemetry. First, configure FluentBit to forward logs to the OpenTelemetry Collector:

```yaml
[OUTPUT]
  Name        forward
  Match       *
  Host        ${OTEL_COLLECTOR_HOST}
  Port        8006
```

Once FluentBit is configured to forward logs to the OpenTelemetry Collector, you can configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to receive logs from FluentBit following [this guide](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/fluentbit_to_signoz/).

---

As part of the migration, you might need to modify your logs pipelines.SigNoz offers several features to enhance your logs:

- **[Log Pipelines](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/introduction/)**: Parse and structure logs with processors like JSON, regex, and grok
- **[Log Querying](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/logs_query_builder/)**: Advanced query capabilities for searching and filtering logs
- **[Log-Trace Correlation](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/guides/trace/)**: Link logs with related traces for contextual debugging

You can also use [Logs Explorer](https://signoz.io/docs/product-features/logs-explorer/) to query logs and confirm that they are being sent correctly to SigNoz.

## Migrating Traces

Migrating your distributed tracing from Tempo to SigNoz involves redirecting your trace collection to SigNoz's OpenTelemetry Collector. The approach you take depends on how your applications are currently instrumented.

### For Applications Using OpenTelemetry

If your applications are already instrumented with OpenTelemetry:

- Follow the [language-specific instrumentation guides](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/).
- If you're using an OpenTelemetry Collector in your environment, update its configuration:

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    # For SigNoz Cloud
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<your-ingestion-key>"
    tls:
      insecure: false

    # For Self-hosted SigNoz
    # endpoint: "<signoz-otel-collector>:4317"
    # tls:
    #   insecure: true
```

### For Applications Using Jaeger or Zipkin

Tempo can be used with open source tracing protocols, including Jaeger, Zipkin, or OpenTelemetry. If you are already using Tempo with this setup, the migration is straightforward:

1. Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector with [Jaeger](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/jaegerreceiver/README.md) and [Zipkin](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/zipkinreceiver/README.md) receivers:

```yaml
receivers:
  # For Zipkin
  zipkin:
    endpoint: 0.0.0.0:9411
  # For Jaeger
  jaeger:
    protocols:
      grpc:
  jaeger/withendpoint:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:14260
```

2. Point your applications to the OpenTelemetry Collector instead of Tempo.
