Migrating your distributed tracing from Tempo to SigNoz involves redirecting your trace collection to SigNoz's OpenTelemetry Collector. The approach you take depends on how your applications are currently instrumented.

### For Applications Using OpenTelemetry

If your applications are already instrumented with OpenTelemetry:

- Follow the [language-specific instrumentation guides](/docs/instrumentation/).
- If you're using an OpenTelemetry Collector in your environment, update its configuration:

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    # For SigNoz Cloud
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<your-ingestion-key>"
    tls:
      insecure: false

    # For Self-hosted SigNoz
    # endpoint: "<signoz-otel-collector>:4317"
    # tls:
    #   insecure: true
```

### For Applications Using Jaeger or Zipkin

Tempo can be used with open source tracing protocols, including Jaeger, Zipkin, or OpenTelemetry. If you are already using Tempo with this setup, the migration is straightforward:

1. Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector with [Jaeger](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/jaegerreceiver/README.md) and [Zipkin](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/zipkinreceiver/README.md) receivers:

```yaml
receivers:
  # For Zipkin
  zipkin:
    endpoint: 0.0.0.0:9411
  # For Jaeger
  jaeger:
    protocols:
      grpc:
  jaeger/withendpoint:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:14260
```

2. Point your applications to the OpenTelemetry Collector instead of Tempo.

SigNoz provides advanced features for analyzing traces:

- **[Trace Explorer](/docs/product-features/trace-explorer/)**: Search, filter, and analyze distributed traces
- **[Service Map](/docs/userguide/service-map/)**: Visualize dependencies between services
- **[Exceptions Monitoring](/docs/userguide/exceptions/)**: Track and analyze application exceptions

By migrating from Tempo to SigNoz, you gain a more integrated experience with metrics and logs, enabling faster troubleshooting and more comprehensive analysis.
