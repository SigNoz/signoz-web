To migrate logs from Loki to SigNoz, you'll need to reconfigure your log collection agents to send data to  OpenTelemetry collectors.

### Using OpenTelemetry Collector for Logs

The most straightforward approach is to use the OpenTelemetry Collector to collect logs directly. Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to collect logs from files, Docker containers, or other sources following [these specific instructions](/docs/logs-management/send-logs-to-signoz/).

However, unless you already using OpenTelemetry Collector for logs, this approach requires you to update log collection for each individual service or application.

### Using FluentBit with OpenTelemetry

If you're already using FluentBit with Loki, you can reconfigure it to work with OpenTelemetry. First, configure FluentBit to forward logs to the OpenTelemetry Collector:

```yaml
[OUTPUT]
  Name        forward
  Match       *
  Host        ${OTEL_COLLECTOR_HOST}
  Port        8006
```

Once FluentBit is configured to forward logs to the OpenTelemetry Collector, you can configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to receive logs from FluentBit following [this guide](/docs/userguide/fluentbit_to_signoz/).

As part of the migration, you might need to modify your logs pipelines. SigNoz offers several features to enhance your logs:

- **[Log Pipelines](/docs/logs-pipelines/introduction/)**: Parse and structure logs with processors like JSON, regex, and grok
- **[Log Querying](/docs/userguide/logs_query_builder/)**: Advanced query capabilities for searching and filtering logs
- **[Log-Trace Correlation](/docs/logs-pipelines/guides/trace/)**: Link logs with related traces for contextual debugging

You can also use [Logs Explorer](/docs/product-features/logs-explorer/) to query logs and confirm that they are being sent correctly to SigNoz.
