---

Grafana dashboards need to be recreated in SigNoz due to differences in the dashboard JSON schemas between the platforms.

### Using Dashboard Templates

SigNoz provides several pre-built dashboard templates:

1. Find the dashboard you want to migrate in [SigNoz Dashboard Templates repository](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards)
2. Navigate to **Dashboards** in SigNoz
3. Click **+ New Dashboard**
4. Click **Import JSON**
5. Either paste or upload the dashboard JSON file

### Creating Custom Dashboards

In case there is no existing dashboard template that you can use, you can create a custom dashboard in SigNoz. Please follow [Manage Dashboards in SigNoz documentation](/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/#steps-to-create-a-custom-dashboard/) for more details.

### Requesting Custom Dashboards

You can also request SigNoz to help you with creating custom dashboards. To request a custom dashboard, please create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/new?assignees=&labels=dashboard-template&template=request_dashboard.md&title=%5BDashboard+Request%5D+) providing details about the dashboard you want to create.

### Dashboard Features

SigNoz supports essential dashboard features including:

- **[Variables](/docs/userguide/manage-variables/)**: Create template variables for dynamic dashboards
- **[Panel Types](/docs/dashboards/panel-types/)**: Various visualization options (time series, bar charts, tables, etc.)
- **[Query Builder](/docs/product-features/query-builder/)**: Construct queries visually or using PromQL

### Panel Types

SigNoz supports most of the common panel types supported by Grafana:

SigNoz does not currently support plugins, so in case you are using any plugins that provide additional panel types in your Grafana, you will need to find an alternative or recreate the same functionality using SigNoz's features.

Please refer to [Panel Types](/docs/dashboards/panel-types/) documentation for more details on the panel types supported by SigNoz.
