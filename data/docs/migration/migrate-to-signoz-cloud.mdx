## Steps to Migrate from Self-Hosted SigNoz to SigNoz Cloud

1. **Update Ingestion Endpoint**  
   - The first step in migrating is updating the ingestion endpoint from your self-hosted SigNoz instance to the SigNoz Cloud ingestion endpoint.

Change your ingestion endpoint to: 

```bash
https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
```
- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint).

2. **Set the Ingestion Key**  
   - You'll need to configure your ingestion key, which can be found in your SigNoz Cloud account settings.
 
Add this as an OTLP header in your telemetry configuration:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<your-ingestion-key>"
```  
Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your actual ingestion key. You can find your key [here](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

3. **Migrate Dashboards & Metadata by contacting Support**  
   - SigNoz support will handle the migration of your metadata, including dashboards, alerts, views, pipelines, users, and other configurations from your 
   self-hosted instance to the cloud.  
   - To begin the migration, provide the SQLite DB file from your self-hosted SigNoz instance. This can typically be found in the location where your SigNoz 
   instance stores the database (usually `/path/to/sigNoz/database.db`).  
   - Compress the SQLite DB file and send it to [SigNoz support](https://signoz.io/support/). Our team will manually import the necessary data from selected 
   tables to ensure a smooth migration of your metadata.  
   - Once the process is complete, you will have all your dashboards and metadata in SigNoz Cloud, ready for use.

4. **Verify Migration**  
   - Confirm that all dashboards and metadata have been migrated correctly by checking your cloud tenant.
