- **Scalability**: SigNoz Cloud automatically adjusts to your growing data needs, ensuring that you can scale up or down effortlessly without worrying about infrastructure limitations.

- **Security and Compliance**: The cloud version provides enhanced security features and compliance with industry standards, giving you peace of mind when it comes to data safety.

- **High Availability and Reliability**: Enjoy the benefits of cloud infrastructure's built-in redundancy and uptime guarantees, ensuring your monitoring setup is always available.

- **Access to New Features**: Get access to the latest SigNoz features and updates automatically with no need to worry about migrations.

## Steps to Migrate from Self-Hosted SigNoz to SigNoz Cloud

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="own-collector" label="Using OTel Collector Agent" default>

If you're using your own OpenTelemetry Collector [agent](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/deployment/agent/) that forwards data to SigNoz self-hosted, you need to update both the endpoint and add the ingestion key.

### 1. Update Your OTel Collector Configuration

In your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file (usually `config.yaml`), update the exporters section:

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
    headers:
      signoz-ingestion-key: <your-ingestion-key>
```

Replace:
- `<region>` with your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- `<your-ingestion-key>` with your actual ingestion key from [here](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

### 2. Restart Your Collector
Restart your OpenTelemetry Collector to apply the new configuration.

<TabItem value="direct-to-signoz" label="Direct to Self-Hosted SigNoz">

If you're sending telemetry data directly from your applications to SigNoz self-hosted's [built-in collector](https://signoz.io/docs/architecture/), you have two migration options:

### Option A: Set up your own OTel Collector (Recommended)

**Step 1: Deploy OpenTelemetry Collector**

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">

Follow the [Kubernetes OTel Collector installation guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/) to install OpenTelemetry Collector in your Kubernetes infrastructure. Make sure to configure it with the proper [ingestion endpoint](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint) and [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/) for SigNoz Cloud.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vm" label="VM/Server">

Follow the [VM OTel Collector installation guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) to install OpenTelemetry Collector on your VM/server. Make sure to configure it with the proper [ingestion endpoint](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint) and [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/) for SigNoz Cloud.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Step 2: Update Application Configuration**
Point your applications to send data to your new collector (for example `http://localhost:4317` for gRPC or `http://localhost:4318` for HTTP).

### Option B: Send directly to SigNoz Cloud

Update your application's telemetry configuration using [OpenTelemetry instrumentation](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/) to send directly to SigNoz Cloud:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<your-ingestion-key>"
```

Replace:
- `<region>` with your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- `<your-ingestion-key>` with your actual ingestion key from [here](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Migrate Dashboards & Metadata

Regardless of your setup, you'll need to migrate your dashboards and configurations:

- SigNoz support will handle the migration of your metadata, including dashboards, alerts, views, pipelines, users, and other configurations from your self-hosted instance to the cloud.
- To begin the migration, provide the SQLite DB file from your self-hosted SigNoz instance. This can typically be found in the location where your SigNoz instance stores the database (usually `/path/to/sigNoz/database.db`).
- Compress the SQLite DB file and send it to [SigNoz support](https://signoz.io/support/). Our team will manually import the necessary data from selected tables to ensure a smooth migration of your metadata.
- Once the process is complete, you will have all your dashboards and metadata in SigNoz Cloud, ready for use.

## Verify Migration

- Confirm that data is flowing to SigNoz Cloud
- Verify all dashboards and metadata have been migrated correctly by checking your cloud tenant.

## Estimate SigNoz Cloud bill

To estimate your SigNoz Cloud bill on the basis of your SigNoz Self-Hosted usage, follow the steps below:

1. Truncate your usage tables:
```
truncate table signoz_metrics.usage on cluster cluster;
truncate table signoz_metrics.usage on cluster cluster;
truncate table signoz_logs.usage on cluster cluster;
```

2. Restart your SigNoz OTel collectors

3. Keep on running and ingesting normal volumes for over 24hrs

4. Now connect to ClickHouse

Follow this [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/clickhouse/connect-to-clickhouse/)

Run below queries to get dump of usage tables:

The below query retrieves all records from the `signoz_logs.usage` table into a CSV file named `logs_usage.csv` with column names as headers.

```
SELECT *
FROM signoz_logs.usage
INTO OUTFILE 'logs_usage.csv'
FORMAT CSVWithNames
```

The below query retrieves all records from the `signoz_traces.usage` table into a CSV file named `traces_usage.csv` with column names as headers.

```
SELECT *
FROM signoz_traces.usage
INTO OUTFILE 'traces_usage.csv'
FORMAT CSVWithNames
```

The below query retrieves all records from the `signoz_metrics.usage` table into a CSV file named `metrics_usage.csv` with column names as headers.
```
SELECT *
FROM signoz_metrics.usage
INTO OUTFILE 'metrics_usage.csv'
FORMAT CSVWithNames
```
