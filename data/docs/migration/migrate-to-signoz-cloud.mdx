## Steps to Migrate from Self-Hosted SigNoz to SigNoz Cloud

<TabItem value="own-collector" label="Using OTel Collector Agent" default>

If you're using your own OpenTelemetry Collector [agent](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/deployment/agent/) that forwards data to SigNoz self-hosted, you need to update both the endpoint and add the ingestion key.

### 1. Update Your OTel Collector Configuration

In your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file (usually `config.yaml`), update the exporters section:

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
    headers:
      signoz-ingestion-key: <your-ingestion-key>
```

Replace:
- `<region>` with your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- `<your-ingestion-key>` with your actual ingestion key from [here](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

### 2. Restart Your Collector
Restart your OpenTelemetry Collector to apply the new configuration.

## Migrate Dashboards & Metadata

Regardless of your setup, you'll need to migrate your dashboards and configurations:

- SigNoz support will handle the migration of your metadata, including dashboards, alerts, views, pipelines, users, and other configurations from your self-hosted instance to the cloud.
- To begin the migration, provide the SQLite DB file from your self-hosted SigNoz instance. This can typically be found in the location where your SigNoz instance stores the database (usually `/path/to/sigNoz/database.db`).
- Compress the SQLite DB file and send it to [SigNoz support](https://signoz.io/support/). Our team will manually import the necessary data from selected tables to ensure a smooth migration of your metadata.
- Once the process is complete, you will have all your dashboards and metadata in SigNoz Cloud, ready for use.

## Verify Migration

- Confirm that data is flowing to SigNoz Cloud
- Verify all dashboards and metadata have been migrated correctly by checking your cloud tenant.
