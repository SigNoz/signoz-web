title: Product Roadmap
---

Our goal is to make the most advanced opentelemetry based observability platform, where you can correlate across different signals like metrics, traces and logs seamlessly and solve issues much faster. 

The user stories we prioritize are based on the feedback we get from our community and the above product direction.

Check our updated Product Roadmap [here](https://github.com/orgs/SigNoz/projects/18/views/1)

We believe in taking feedback from our community. Feel free to jump to our [Github Discussions](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/discussions) if you have any idea or feature we should build first. We are all ears ðŸ‘‚ðŸ‘‚

## Multi-Tenancy
One company should be able to onboard different teams which have different datasets. Multi-tenancy enables users to manage multiple datasets in the same database without doing multiple installations of SigNoz.

## Cost Control
- Monitoring and limiting team-wise quota
- Check on cardinality explosion in metrics and suggestions of deletion of unused attributes in timeseries
- Tail based sampling on latency, error or any attribute in spans and logs

## Tail based sampling

The decision of which spans to sample is crucial in distributed tracing. "Tail-based sampling" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived.

We plan to focus on this to ensure that only 'interesting' traces are ingested. This will ensure that we don't miss any interesting traces, even though the actual number of traces ingested/retained is much lower.


## Anomaly detection framework

A framework to provide dynamic thresholding capabilities to enable better Signal to Noise in alerts. One of the projects we are closely following in this space is LinkedIn's [Third Eye](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/01/introducing-thirdeye--linkedins-business-wide-monitoring-platfor) If you know of any other good frameworks, please share in [Github Discussions](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/discussions) --> */}
