## General Troubleshooting

When encountering issues with ingestion, follow these steps to diagnose and potentially resolve the problem:

1. **Enable diagnostic logs**: To enhance error tracking, configure your OTLP client to capture comprehensive diagnostic logs by following the instructions listed [below](#collect-diagnostic-logs).

2. **Verify endpoint connectivity**: Use a simple shell command like `curl <endpoint>` from the machine in question to determine if there are any local network configuration issues (such as firewall restrictions) preventing connectivity to the ingestion endpoint. You can find your endpoint [here](/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/).

3. **Validate Ingestion Key**: Ensure your Ingestion key is valid and properly set. Invalid or missing Ingestion keys are a common issue that typically present with HTTP 403 or 401 status codes, or gRPC Unauthenticated or PermissionDenied status codes. If you encounter these, double-check that your Ingestion key is valid, correctly configured and has not expired.

4. **Validate Ingestion Limits**: Incorrect Ingestion key limits may inadvertently restrict your data flow. Verify your current Ingestion limits to ensure optimal data throughput. For a comprehensive understanding of how these limits function, refer to our [Ingestion Key Limits documentation](/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/).

5. **Evaluate retry success**: Confirm if exports succeed after retry attempts. While occasional transient errors are expected, persistent failures may indicate a more significant issue. If you suspect that transient errors are occurring more frequently than expected, please reachout to SigNoz support.

6. **Monitor non-retried errors**: Be on the lookout for scenarios where transient errors are not being retried. Despite best efforts, there may be corner cases where the ingestion endpoint returns non-retriable status codes for transient errors. If you believe you've encountered this scenario, please reachout to SigNoz support.

## Collect Diagnostic Logs
Diagnostic Logs capture critical information that helps identify root causes of issues and provides essential context for troubleshooting, whether performed by you or the SigNoz Support team.

### Opentelemetry Collector
In order to enable detailed log information, add the following snippet to your collector configuration:
```
service:
  telemetry:
    logs:
      level: DEBUG
```

### Language SDKs
Refer to the SigNoz [instrumentation docs](/docs/instrumentation/) for language-specific details.

## Issues Catalog

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="400" label="Bad Request" default>
**Root Cause:**
  - Payload is malformed

**Resolution:** 
  - Depending upon the endpoint, consult the relevant documenation to verify the payload schema.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="401" label="Unauthorized" default>
**Root Cause:**
  - Ingestion key is invalid or malformed.
  - Ingestion key has expired.

**Resolution:** 
  - Ensure Ingestion key is properly included in headers. 
  - Ensure Ingestion key has not expired.

Refer to our [Ingestion Key documentation](/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/) for more information.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="404" label="Not Found" default>
**Root Cause:**
  - Ingestion key does not exist.
  - Ingestion endpoint does not exist. 
  - Trailing slashes are being used. eg.`/logs/json/`

**Resolution:** 
  - Ensure Ingestion key does not have any typo. 
  - Ensure the Ingestion endpoint exists in SigNoz.
  - Remove the trailing slash.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="408" label="Request Timeout">
**Root Cause:**
  - Payloads are large.
  - Networks are slower.

**Resolution:** 
Refer to the [Important Considerations](/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#important-considerations) section of our Ingestion documentation.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="413" label="Content Too Large">
**Root Cause:**
  - Payloads are larger than the permissible limits.

**Resolution:** 
  - Ensure payloads are within permissible limits.

Refer to the [Important Considerations](/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#important-considerations) section of our Ingestion documentation.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="499" label="Client closed the connection">
**Root Cause:**
  - Payloads are large.
  - Networks are slower.

**Resolution:** 
Refer to the [Important Considerations](/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#important-considerations) section of our Ingestion documentation.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="503|504" label="Service Unavailable|Gateway Timeout">
**Root Cause:**
  - Payloads are large.
  - Networks are slower.

**Resolution:** 
Refer to the [Important Considerations](/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#important-considerations) section of our Ingestion documentation.
