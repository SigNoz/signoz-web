# OTLP Troubleshooting Guide

## General Troubleshooting

When encountering issues with OTLP data ingestion, follow these steps to diagnose and potentially resolve the problem:

1. **Enable diagnostic logs**: Configure your OTLP client to log detailed error information. The method for enabling logs varies by implementation, so consult the relevant documentation for your specific setup.

2. **Verify endpoint connectivity**: Use a simple shell command like `curl signoz cloud endpoint` from the machine in question to determine if there are any local network configuration issues (such as firewall restrictions) preventing connectivity to the ingestion endpoint.

{/* 3. **Check for integration error events**: Query for `SigNozIntegrationError` events in your monitoring system. The ingestion process performs minimal validation synchronously before returning a success status code. If you don't see indications of export errors in your application logs, but data isn't appearing in your monitoring dashboard, these events may provide insights into issues detected during asynchronous validation. */}

3. **Isolate the problem**: Often, errors are localized to a specific application or environment. Evaluate the differences between problematic and properly functioning areas to narrow down potential causes.

4. **Validate API key**: Ensure your API key is valid and properly set. Invalid or missing API keys are a common issue that typically present with HTTP 403 or 401 status codes, or gRPC Unauthenticated or PermissionDenied status codes. If you encounter these, double-check that your API key is valid and correctly configured.

5. **Evaluate retry success**: Confirm if exports succeed after retry attempts. While occasional transient errors are expected, persistent failures may indicate a more significant issue. If you suspect that transient errors are occurring more frequently than expected, please reachout to SigNoz support.

6. **Monitor non-retried errors**: Be on the lookout for scenarios where transient errors are not being retried. Despite best efforts, there may be corner cases where the ingestion endpoint returns non-retriable status codes for transient errors. If you believe you've encountered this scenario, please reachout to SigNoz support.

By systematically working through these steps, you can often identify and resolve common OTLP ingestion issues. For persistent problems that you can't resolve through these methods, please reachout to SigNoz support.
