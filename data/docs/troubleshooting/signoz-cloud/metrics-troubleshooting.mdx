Try changing the variable in Dashboard. 
For example, if you're using the **[Kubernetes Pod Metrics - Overall](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/k8s-infra-metrics/kubernetes-pod-metrics-overall.json)** dashboard, you can select $node_name variable as **ALL** to see the data as shown in below image.

[Add a panel](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-panels/) in a Dashboard and you can see the metrics in dropdown.

We are working on Metrics explorer which will allow viewing all metrics without using the Dashboards. 
This will be live soon!

This functionality doesn't work at the moment so it's disabled.
