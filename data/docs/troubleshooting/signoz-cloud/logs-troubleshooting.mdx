### Q. In java my mdc attributes are not visible in SigNoz

<details>

<summary> Toggle for answer </summary>

You can get your mdc attributes by using the [appender settings](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/collecting_application_logs_otel_sdk_java#settings-for-appender-instrumentation-based-on-the-logging-library) and passing it as `-D<property>=<value>` format.

For example, for **logback** you can use `otel.instrumentation.logback-appender.experimental.capture-mdc-attributes=*` and for **log4j** you can use `otel.instrumentation.log4j-appender.experimental.capture-mdc-attributes=*`. Checkout [this documentation](`otel.instrumentation.log4j-appender.experimental.capture-mdc-attributes=*`) for more system properties.
