[Trace Funnels](https://signoz.io/docs/trace-funnels/overview/) works automatically with properly instrumented applications that export traces to SigNoz. This document explains the requirements needed for this feature to work effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin using Trace Funnels, ensure you have:

- Tracing Enabled - Your application must be [instrumented](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/) and exporting spans to SigNoz

## Definitions

Understanding these key terms will help you effectively use Trace Funnels:

- **Trace**: A collection of spans representing a single end-to-end request
- **Span**: A timed operation within a trace (e.g., an HTTP request, database query)
- **Funnel Step**: One of up to three sequential operations you wish to track
- **Conversion Rate**: The percentage of requests that successfully complete a step
- **Transition**: The movement from one step to the next within the same trace

## Setup

For every span that you want to include in your funnels, ensure the following [attributes](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-spans/#what-are-span-attributes) are present:

- `service.name` - The name of the service emitting the span
- `span.name` - The name of the specific operation
- `trace.id` - The unique identifier for the trace (automatically added by OpenTelemetry)

These span attributes are used to automatically correlate spans within the same trace and identify sequential operations.

<Admonition>
In case of manual instrumentation, ensure that all spans include the required attributes and that the `service.name` and `span.name` are set to meaningful values that clearly identify your operations.
</Admonition>

## Verification

To verify that your instrumentation is correctly configured for Trace Funnels:

1. Generate some traffic that includes the operations you want to monitor
2. Navigate to the [Trace Explorer](/docs/userguide/traces) and search for traces
3. Verify that your spans have meaningful `service.name` and `span.name` values
4. Navigate to the Trace Funnels section in SigNoz
5. Create a new funnel and verify that your services and span names appear in the dropdowns

## Accessing Trace Funnels

To access the Trace Funnels feature:

1. In the navigation bar, click **Traces**
2. At the top of the Traces page, select **Trace Funnels**

The Trace Funnels button appears beside the main search bar.

## Troubleshooting

If your services or span names aren't appearing in the Trace Funnels interface:

- Check that your service is properly [instrumented](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/) and sending traces to SigNoz
- Verify that your spans include the required `service.name` and `span.name` attributes
- Ensure that your OpenTelemetry collector is properly configured and forwarding all attributes
- Check the [Trace Explorer](/docs/userguide/traces) to confirm that traces are being ingested correctly
- For manual instrumentation, ensure you're setting all required attributes explicitly

## Next Steps

Once your application is properly instrumented and you can access Trace Funnels, head to the [Overview section](/docs/trace-funnels/overview) to learn how to create and use Trace Funnels to gain insights into your request flows and identify performance bottlenecks.
